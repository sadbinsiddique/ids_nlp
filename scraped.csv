In the statement, the media office described the actions as “one of the most horrific crimes against humanity in modern times,” accusing Israel of continuing to carry out brutal massacres against defenseless civilians in Gaza, with children being a primary target of airstrikes. “Over the past twenty days, Israel has committed a shocking act of genocide against childhood, with 490 children martyred in a series of barbaric attacks,” the statement read. “This brings the total number of martyrs during this period to 1,350.” The statement rejected Israeli claims that civilian casualties are merely incidental, instead arguing that the figures alone reflect a deliberate, systematic policy of targeting Palestinian children in violation of international law. Last weekend, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to escalate attacks on Gaza as efforts are underway to implement US President Donald Trump’s plan to displace Palestinians from the enclave. Nearly 50,700 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza in a brutal Israeli onslaught since October 2023, most of them women and children. The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants last November for Netanyahu and his former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. Israel also faces a genocide case at the International Court of Justice for its war on the enclave. NativeClick Ads (With inputs from Anadolu Ajansı)"

Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior and Security Jacquemain Shabani said the torrential downpour, which occurred overnight from Friday to Saturday, has caused major damage across several districts of the capital, leaving dozens injured and destroying numerous homes. In response, the government has set up a crisis management unit in coordination with the armed forces, several ministries and the Kinshasa provincial government to carry out evacuations and deploy emergency teams. The flooding has paralyzed much of the city’s infrastructure, submerging major roads and triggering widespread power and water outages across the city. The Ministry of Transport reported severe disruption to routes to and from the N’djili International Airport, prompting the deployment of emergency ferry services to assist stranded travelers. Meteorologists forecast continued heavy rainfall in the coming days, raising fears of further destruction in the city of 17 million people.

The foreign ministry said this in a statement on Monday. According to the statement, the Government of Bangladesh demands that Israel immediately cease all military operations, exercise maximum restraint, and abide by its duty under international humanitarian law. It said that Bangladesh strongly denounced the Israeli Occupying Forces’ indiscriminate aerial bombardment of densely populated civilian areas in Gaza with the overt intention of carrying out ethnic cleansing against the defenseless Palestinian population. Israel’s ongoing military attacks since last month's unilateral breach of the ceasefire have killed scores of Palestinians, mostly women and children as well as blocked the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza leading to a human catastrophe. Evidently, Israel has shown no regard to repeated international appeals and has instead engaged in an increasingly intense killing spree, said the foreign ministry. Bangladesh appealed to the international community, in particular the United Nations (UN) to discharge its moral and legal responsibilities by adopting immediate and effective steps towards the implementation of an unconditional ceasefire. Dhaka called for the cessation of all hostilities for the protection of lives of civilians and unobstructed passage of humanitarian relief to besieged Gaza. NativeClick Ads The foreign ministry reaffirmed the strong support of the Bangladesh Government for all the just rights of the Palestinian people, their right to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent and sovereign State of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.

Bangladesh also appealed to all concerned to commit themselves to the path of diplomacy and dialogue to put an end to the violence and sufferings afflicting the Palestinian people. Bangladesh further remained steadfast and unequivocal in its call on the global community to work towards a two state solution of the Palestinian issue based on international law, United Nations resolutions, and the Palestinian aspirations for peace, dignity, and justice, said the statement."

Fisheries and Livestock Adviser Farida Akhtar made this announcement at a press conference at the ministry's conference room on Monday afternoon. She said conserving jatka would boost hilsa production, helping to stabilize prices and ensure better market supply. The advisor mentioned that the interim government has implemented an effective action plan to make Hilsa affordable for common people and as part of this effort, Jatka Conservation Week will be observed during April 8 to 14. The theme for this year's event is “If Jatka Fishing is Stopped Hilsa will be Caught in Nets.” Jatka refers to a small Hilsa fish, measuring around 10 inches or 25 centimeters. A hilsa weighing one kilogram typically measures between 40 and 50 centimeters, and if it weighs more than 2 kilograms, it reaches about 60 to 62 centimeters. Through the Jatka Conservation Week, Jatka will be allowed to grow into a mature hilsa. During the 2023-24 fiscal year, the country produced 5,29,000 metric tons of Hilsa, contributing roughly 11 percent of the nation's total fish production. Hilsa also plays a significant role in the national economy, contributing over 1 percent to the GDP. Bangladesh is the world's leading producer of Hilsa, accounting for over 80 percent of global production, harvested from the country's rivers, estuaries, and seas. It ranks the first among the 11 Hilsa-producing countries. NativeClick Ads The Fisheries Adviser highlighted that the government not only enforces laws to protect Jatka but also significantly increased the amount of VGF (Vulnerable Group Feeding) food assistance for fishermen during the ban of hilsa fishing. In the 2023-24 fiscal year, 361,071 fishing families who stopped fishing Jatka were provided with 28,885 metric tons of VGF rice, distributed at a rate of 40 kg per month for four months. To protect mother Hilsa during its main breeding season, 13,707 metric tons of VGF rice were distributed to 566,565 fishing families, at a rate of 25 kg each, during the same fiscal year. Besides food aid, various types of assistance, including the provision of calf calves, are being offered to fishermen through the ""Hilsa Resource Development and Management Project"" to create alternative employment opportunities. The Fisheries Adviser urged everyone to cooperate in protecting Jatka.

Beijing retaliated on Sunday, following last week's decision by Trump to slap a 34% tax on Chinese imports as part of his ""Liberation Day"" that set a minimum 10% levy on nearly all of America's trading partners. In a social media post on Monday, Trump gave China until Tuesday to scrap its countermeasure or face the 50% tax. In response, the Chinese embassy in the US accused Washington of ""economic bullying"", and said that Beijing ""will firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests"". If Trump acts on his threat, US companies could face a total rate of 104% on Chinese imports- as it comes on top of 20% tariffs already put in place in March and the 34% announced last week. There are fears that this could deepen a trade war between the world's two biggest economies and global rivals.

Beijing shot back, saying that ""pressuring or threatening China is not a right way to engage"". ""The US hegemonic move in the name of 'reciprocity' serves its selfish interests at the expense of other countries' legitimate interests and puts 'America first' over international rules,"" Chinese embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu said in a statement. ""This is a typical move of unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying."" Speaking from the White House, the US president said there could be both permanent tariffs and negotiations. ""We have $36tn (£28tn) debt for a reason,"" he said, adding that the US would be talking to China among other countries to make a ""fair deal and a good deal"".

The attack was conducted by an Israeli drone which targeted a motorcycle repair shop in the border town of Taybeh, with Israel claiming to have struck “a commander in Hezbollah’s artillery system.” A Lebanese security source said the attack targeted “a motorcycle as its rider stopped in front of a motorcycle repair shop on the Taybeh-Adaisseh road, resulting in his death and a fire breaking out at the location.” Hezbollah later identified the deceased man as Mohammed Adnan Mansour. Under the terms of the ceasefire agreement, Hezbollah was meant to withdraw fighters from south of the Litani River and dismantle any remaining military infrastructure there. Israel was to withdraw all its forces from southern Lebanon but continues to hold five positions that it deems “strategic.” Lebanon’s President Joseph Aoun has urged Washington to pressure Israel to withdraw from the five border points, saying the ongoing troop presence “complicates the situation.” On Monday, the Lebanese government received a message from the US confirming the need to disarm Hezbollah and implement necessary reforms for the country to receive financial aid, with Washington anticipating swift action on these issues. NativeClick Ads A delegation from the American Task Force on Lebanon, headed by Edward Gabriel, conveyed the message to Aoun. Aoun said there is no place for any weapons or armed groups outside the framework of the Lebanese state. Aoun on Monday said the issue needed to be resolved “through communication and dialogue because, in the end, Hezbollah is a Lebanese component.” Authorities would soon begin drafting a “national security strategy,” he added. During a meeting with the delegation, Aoun reaffirmed Lebanon’s full commitment to UN Resolution 1701, commending the work of UNIFIL south of the Litani River. Aoun pointed to “Israeli violations of the ceasefire agreement,” saying that “Israel’s continued presence in the five hills it occupied will not be beneficial for Lebanon and will further complicate the situation. “Therefore, we call on the US to pressure Israel to withdraw from them,” he added. “The Lebanese Army, north of the Litani River, dismantled six camps that were under the control of Palestinian groups outside the refugee camps,” Aoun continued. “They are now empty, and the weapons found were either confiscated or destroyed.” Aoun confirmed that “the priority is to reduce tension in the south.” He added: “The will is there, and the UNIFIL are doing their job to the fullest. But we must take into account that they are bearing many responsibilities. Lebanon needs time to resolve matters calmly.” Aoun noted that “three weeks ago, the government approved the recruitment of 4,500 soldiers to boost our preparedness in the south.” He emphasized to the American delegation that “reforms and the disarmament of weapons are demands from Lebanon, as well as from the international community and the US. We are committed to working towards these goals, and building trust is a step we have already initiated.” Gabriel spoke about the “significant recognition of the efforts made by the Lebanese Army and the commendable work of the president.” He stated: “I understand that your contribution to this was extremely important, and there are still many tasks that need to be completed, which we have been made aware of. The sooner these are carried out, the quicker we can assist you.” Gabriel revealed that “a funding bill is being prepared in Congress for the upcoming year, along with three significant pieces of legislation included in the economic package.” Aoun also met on Monday with Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri to discuss the outcomes of the visit of US Deputy Envoy to the Middle East Morgan Ortagus to Lebanon last weekend. According to a political observer, the emphasis was placed on “expediting the approval of reform laws in parliament” after “constructive and positive” discussions with Ortagus.

The average global temperature last month was 1.6C (2.88F) higher than in pre-industrial times, the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said on Tuesday. The findings, contained in C3S’s monthly report, underscore growing concerns that the international goal of limiting global warming by the year 2100 to 1.5C (2.7F) above pre-industrial levels is slipping out of reach. Scientists have warned that every fraction of a degree of global warming increases the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, heavy rainfall and droughts.

"science-technology","https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111555","Tariffs on China set to rise to at least 104%: Trump","09/04/2025","US President Donald Trump is set to impose an astounding 104% in levies across all Chinese imports on Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt announced on Tuesday. This comes on top of Chinese tariffs that were in place prior to Trump’s second term, reports CNN. China was already set to see tariffs increase by 34% on Wednesday as part of Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs package. But the president tacked on another 50% after Beijing didn’t back off on its promise to impose 34% retaliatory tariffs on US goods by noon Tuesday, adding an additional 84% in duties. Earlier Tuesday, China’s Commerce Ministry said it “firmly opposes” the additional 50% tariffs on Chinese imports, calling it “a mistake upon a mistake.” The ministry vowed to escalate its retaliation on US exports. US stocks, which soared Tuesday morning, began moving lower following Leavitt’s comments. Markets ultimately ended the day markedly lower. The Dow fell 320 points, or 0.84%. The broader S&P 500 fell 1.57%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 2.15%. “Countries like China, who have chosen to retaliate and try to double down on their mistreatment of American workers, are making a mistake,” Leavitt told reporters on Tuesday. “President Trump has a spine of steel, and he will not break.” “The Chinese want to make a deal, they just don’t know how to do it,” she added. She declined to share what, if any, terms Trump would consider to lower tariffs on China. Asian markets largely tracked Wall Street’s losses, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 opening about 3% lower on Wednesday. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng also fell 3%. South Korea’s Kopsi and Australia’s benchmark ASX 200 index were each down about 1%. Along with increasing China’s overall tariff rate, President Trump also signed an executive order Tuesday night tripling tariffs on goods worth less than $800 from the country. As it stands, packages under $800 have been exempt from tariffs through the so-called “de minimus” exemption. NativeClick Ads Initially, those goods were set to face tariffs of 30% come May 2. But Trump’s latest executive order hiked the rates to 90%. This will impact Americans who order from sites like Shein, Temu and AliExpress, likely leading to higher prices of the goods. In February, Trump had initially imposed a 10% tariff on all Chinese goods, with no exceptions, tying it to the country’s alleged role in aiding illegal immigration and getting fentanyl into the US. Last month, he doubled those rates. China was America’s second largest source of imports last year, shipping a total of $439 billion worth of goods to the US, while the US exported $144 billion worth of goods to China. The mutual tariffs threaten to hurt domestic industries and are poised to result in layoffs. When Trump’s first term ended, the US charged an average tariff rate of 19.3% on Chinese goods, according to a Peterson Institute for International Economic analysis. The Biden administration kept most of Trump’s tariffs in place while also adding additional ones, bringing the average rate to 20.8%. Come Wednesday, the total average tariff on Chinese exports to the US will soar to nearly 125%._Agencies."

These things were said in the report titled ‘Country Private Sector Diagnostic’ of the World Bank Group at the Bangladesh Investment Summit 2025 on Wednesday.

Now, there will be no scope to export Bangladeshi products to Nepal and Bhutan through the land route. The Indian Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) issued a circular on Tuesday, officially withdrawing the transshipment facility. At the same time, it repealed its previous order dated 29 June 2020, which had enabled the transshipment. According to information available on the CBIC’s official website, the 2020 order permitted Bangladeshi exports to third countries to transit through Indian customs stations and exit via other ports or airports within India. This arrangement, known as transshipment, enabled Bangladeshi cargo to reach Nepal and Bhutan by passing through Indian land routes and switching transport vehicles at designated customs points. The new order stipulates that the facility is no longer valid. However, goods that are already in transit within Indian territory under the previous arrangement will be allowed to exit the country without hindrance. Under the transshipment process, Bangladeshi goods destined for Nepal and Bhutan travel through Indian land routes, where the cargo is transferred from one vehicle to another at the border and Indian customs checkpoints. The decision to revoke this facility is likely to impact trade logistics and export operations between Bangladesh and its landlocked neighbors.

On Wednesday, the president said he was increasing the import tax on China to 125 percent, even as he postponed similar punishing levies on most other countries for three months. He also left in place new tariffs on automobiles, steel and aluminum. But on Thursday the White House put out a statement making it clear the 125 percent rise was in addition to a 20 percent tariff Mr. Trump had already imposed on China for its role in supplying fentanyl and its precursors in the United States. While tensions between Beijing and Washington showed no signs of easing, the European Union responded to Mr. Trump’s decision to put off implementing a hefty import tax on its goods by announcing it would also delay its retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports for 90 days. After Mr. Trump announced the tariff pause, the S&P 500 posted its biggest daily gain since 2008. By midday Thursday, the index has dropped around 4 percent, a decline that deepened in the hour after the White House clarified the tariff on China was steeper than initially expected. The three-month delay on most country-specific tariffs, which Mr. Trump’s says are aimed at reversing bilateral trade deficits, did not temper the concerns of many economists who cautioned that the full repercussions from the trade war between Washington and Beijing would not be felt for weeks. A report released on Thursday showed that U.S. inflation eased more than expected in March, providing what economists say is likely to be only a temporary reprieve before Mr. Trump’s tariffs are expected to reignite price pressures.

Concerns have intensified due to the lack of a resolution regarding the climate fund at the COP29 conference in Baku. Poorer countries expressed dissatisfaction with this commitment, Environmentalists are starting to lose confidence in the United Nations Climate Change Conference. Environmentalists have commented that these conferences have failed to exert effective pressure on global leaders to protect the climate. Particularly at COP29, disappointment and frustration have arisen following the decision on new financing decision. Therefore, they are demanding accelerated aid and specific commitments regarding carbon credits and climate compensation at the upcoming conference (COP30). Environmentalists believe the UN should take a more robust role in this regard. In the future world, the impacts of climate change have emerged as the biggest challenge. It is not just the problem of a single nation or a specific region, but rather a global issue. Therefore, to address the challenges posed by climate change, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has been held annually since 1995. At the 29th United Nations Climate Conference in Baku, Azerbaijan, the focus was primarily on financing. Before the conference even began, there were controversies, doubts, and concerns. From November 11, representatives from 200 countries, totaling 85,000 individuals, engaged in discussions about funding, finance, adaptation, and promised commitments. The presence of large delegations from oil-producing countries and multinational corporations cast a shadow of skepticism and debate over the entire conference. Throughout the two-week event, various sessions sparked extensive discussions on these issues. On the final day, prolonged talks ensued due to a lack of consensus. Wealthy nations, including the European Union and the United States, agreed to provide $300 billion annually to climate funds by 2035, following extended discussions at Azerbaijan's COP-29 conference. However, while there was agreement on a deal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, critics and developing nations labeled the financial assistance as inadequate. Additionally, environmentalists expressed skepticism about how effective the agreement would be. This year, developing countries, including Bangladesh, sought $1.3 trillion annually to address the damages caused by climate change. High carbon dioxide emissions are a significant contributor to climate change, with 80% of these emissions attributed to developed countries. Consequently, calls for compensation for affected nations emerged from the Paris Climate Conference. Although there was some agreement on fund creation, there was little urgency regarding financing. To combat climate risks, the G7 coalition of affected countries, including Bangladesh, is demanding $500 trillion in grants from carbon-emitting nations. They have set a target for this new funding annually until 2030. However, during the COP-29 conference, developed and affected nations did not reach consensus on this matter. By 2024, global temperatures are projected to rise by at least 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels. The world is currently experiencing its hottest decade. The goal was to keep the increase in global temperatures below 1.5 degrees Celsius. Carbon-emitting countries are expected to contribute $10 billion annually to the UN Green Fund for addressing the climate crisis, yet temperatures have risen by 0.8 degrees Celsius instead of decreasing. Environmental activists believe that despite ongoing discussions at COP conferences, real change is taking too long. Many countries face accusations of not taking sufficient action against climate change, particularly developed nations, which are often deemed most responsible and yet fail to take adequate measures. Additionally, countries affected by climate change are claiming compensation, but developed nations are reluctant to assist. Environmentalists are also frustrated by the continued use of fossil fuels and the lack of investment in renewable energy sources. As a result, activists are advocating for alternative climate change conferences, arguing that traditional conferences are heavily influenced by large countries and corporate interests. In contrast, alternative conferences are said to prioritize the opinions of local communities, environmental organizations, and people from various backgrounds. While conventional conferences emphasize new ideas, technologies, and solutions, discussions often get mired in political disputes. In alternative conferences, there is a greater focus on solutions, and activists also wish to discuss the local impacts of climate change and potential remedies. NativeClick Ads Their demands include taking rapid and effective action against climate change, enforcing stricter targets for carbon emissions, providing adequate compensation to countries affected by climate change, increasing investment in renewable energy sources while phasing out fossil fuel use, and urging world leaders to adopt a stronger and clearer stance on climate change. Additionally, through alternative conferences, they seek to ensure compensation for countries harmed by the actions of developed nations, reduce fossil fuel consumption, explore new energy sources, change food production and distribution systems in the context of climate change, and find solutions by utilizing the knowledge and experience of local communities. In fact, such alternative climate conferences can play a crucial role in the fight against climate change, steering the world towards more practical and effective solutions. Anti-COP or alternative climate conferences are typically held alongside COP conferences, although they have sometimes taken place in separate locations. The first alternative climate conference began in 2009 in Copenhagen, surrounding the COP-15 conference. At that time, climate activists opposed the structure of the main conference, raising claims against protests, unnecessary discussions, and corporate interests. Following this, protests and the scope of alternative climate conferences expanded during COP-16 (2010, Cancun) and COP-17 (2011, Doha). Subsequently, environmentalists and climate activists began participating en masse in these alternative conferences. To understand why there are protests surrounding climate conferences, it is essential to first grasp the main topics of these conferences and the positions of various parties involved. Environmentalists protest in Baku, Azerbaijan, demanding that rich countries pay more to help poor countries combat the effects of climate change. Photo: Collected Evaluating Previous COP Conferences: The first COP1 conference took place in Berlin, Germany, from March 2 to April 7, 1995. This conference made decisions regarding joint efforts to combat global climate change. The UN Climate Change COP21 conference was held in Paris, France, in 2015. Based on the opinions of 196 countries, the Paris Agreement was recommended at this conference. The agreement determined to limit global warming to within 1.5 degrees Celsius. It was deemed reasonable to keep global warming within this limit to address droughts, irregular rainfall, salinity, and natural disasters worldwide. It was also stated that greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced by approximately 43% by 2030. Therefore, the Paris Agreement was a binding and groundbreaking climate change treaty, opening discussions on how to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. At the COP26 conference, the allocation of funds for building resilience against climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions was widely discussed. The issue of developed countries providing $100 billion annually to developing nations to combat climate change was addressed. The conversation also included visible plans to prevent greenhouse gas emissions and what further action plans could be added for the future. As a result, it is possible to keep global warming within the 1.5 degrees Celsius limit mentioned in the Paris Agreement. Among the key topics discussed at COP27 was the specific allocation of funds each year to help developing countries recover from climate-related disasters. The conference emphasized a strong demand to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 43% by 2030. The need for transparency and accountability from businesses in tackling climate change was also highlighted. There was a call for companies to develop concrete plans within the following year on how they would address climate change. Additionally, discussions were held regarding the Green Climate Fund, which proposed allocations of $211.68 million for developed countries and $70.6 million for least developed countries. Furthermore, the establishment of a special fund of $35 million for climate change was welcomed. Consideration of a new climate change fund by 2024, based on the needs and priorities of developing countries, was also ongoing. Ultimately, the UN's permanent committee was tasked with preparing a report on doubling the climate change fund by 2024. At COP28, nearly 200 countries agreed to gradually phase out the use of fossil fuels. Representatives from these countries committed to gradually halting the use of oil, gas, and coal to avoid the adverse effects of climate change, which climate experts view as a ""historic"" agreement in the past 30 years. However, there remains skepticism about what countries like Bangladesh and others affected by climate change will gain from this agreement. The cessation of fossil fuel use was prioritized at the conference. Meanwhile, the global temperature has started to rise due to the inability to reduce fossil fuel use. Yet, no government has ever reached a consensus on when or how this reduction will take place. At the latest COP29 conference, discussions focused on alternative allocations, raising concerns that previous initiatives may have fallen short. Some environmental activists have indicated that there may not be significant demands from developing countries at the upcoming COP30 conference this year. Expert Opinion: Dr. Mohammad Shamsuddoha, the CEO of Center for Participatory Research and Development (CPRD), stated that the coalition of affected countries, G7, has demanded $500 billion in grants from carbon-emitting nations to address climate risks. However, at the COP29 conference, developed and affected countries could not reach an agreement on this issue because developed countries seek guarantees on their investments in climate change. For example, if a developed country lends Bangladesh $100 to mitigate climate risks, it requires assurance that Bangladesh can repay this amount, with interest, after a specified time. Without such guarantees, the loan remains uncertain. He noted that during the latest conference, many poor nations affected by climate change expressed anger at the indecisiveness of wealthy countries. These disaster-stricken countries labeled the promised funds from wealthy nations, responsible for global pollution, as ""insultingly trivial."" He believes that organizing alternative conferences may not provide a good solution. Instead, it would be better to make the annual UN events (COP) more effective. Arifur Rahman, a Bangladeshi journalist working on climate change, stated, ""Climate change is one of the greatest environmental challenges faced by societies today. It has significant implications for energy, food, and water security, as well as health and safety for countries and people around the world."" However, he noted that the issues of impact and compensation for poor countries are not receiving adequate attention at COP conferences. It is crucial for these countries to send more representatives and present data on their losses to portray the real picture. The UN should also apply pressure on wealthy nations to ensure that affected countries can benefit. The EU representative Wopke Hoekstra, welcomed the new $300 billion climate agreement, stating that the COP29 conference will be remembered as the beginning of a new era in climate financing. Conversely, Mohamed Adow, director of the research organization Power Shift Africa, criticized the agreement, stating, ""This COP is a disaster for the developing world. The wealthy countries that claim to take climate change seriously have betrayed the planet and its inhabitants."" The writer is a senior journalist"

No new humanitarian supplies have entered the Palestinian enclave since Israel blocked the entry of aid trucks on March 2, as talks stalled on the next stage of a now broken truce. Israel resumed its military assault on March 18. Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said 25,000 aid trucks had entered Gaza in the 42 days of the ceasefire and that Hamas had used the aid to rebuild its war machine, an allegation which the group has denied. Spoljaric said supplies were running critically low. “For six weeks, nothing has come in, so we will, in a couple of weeks’ time, run out of supplies that we need to keep the hospital going,” she said. The World Health Organization said supplies of antibiotics and blood bags were dwindling fast. Twenty-two out of 36 hospitals in the enclave are only minimally functional, Dr. Rik Peeperkorn told reporters in Geneva via video link in Jerusalem. The Red Cross president also raised concern about the safety of humanitarian operations. NativeClick Ads “It is extremely dangerous for the population to move, but it’s especially also dangerous for us to operate,” Spoljaric said. In March, the bodies of 15 emergency and aid workers, including eight members of the Palestinian Red Crescent, were found buried in a mass grave in southern Gaza. The U.N. and Red Crescent accused Israeli forces of killing them. The Israeli military said on Monday that an initial investigation showed that the incident occurred “due to a sense of threat” after it said it had identified six Hamas militants in the vicinity. Spoljaric called for an immediate ceasefire in order to release the remaining hostages held by Hamas and to address grave humanitarian issues in Gaza. Israel began its military campaign in Gaza in October 2023 after Hamas-led militants killed 1,200 people and took some 250 hostages on a raid into Israel, according to Israeli tallies. Since then, more than 50,800 Palestinians have been killed and much of the territory has been reduced to rubble."

The deal, reached between the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU)/Christian Social Union (CSU) alliance and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), removes a key feature of last year’s naturalisation reform. Introduced in June 2024 by the outgoing SPD-led coalition, the expedited three-year path required applicants to demonstrate advanced C1-level German and strong integration indicators such as community service or academic excellence. Critics within the CDU and CSU had labelled the route “turbo” naturalisation and argued that three years of residency was insufficient for full integration. While the fast-track path will be removed, the standard five-year route to citizenship will remain. This requires applicants to hold an intermediate B1-level of German and continuous residency in the country.

"science-technology","https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111627","Biodiversity silent driving force of economy remains neglected","12/04/2025","There is an ongoing decline in biodiversity, just as there is a simultaneous loss of biodiversity for many other living beings. One of the main reasons for this decline is climate change. Biodiversity plays an essential role in the global economy. But, this silent driving force of the economy remains neglected in most of the countries. Global biodiversity loss inflicts considerable economic damage measurable in monetary terms, severely affecting agriculture, tourism, and natural resource industries. Immediate impacts are evident, as Sub-Saharan Africa suffers approximately $2.1 billion in agricultural losses annually. Medium-term effects are seen in Southeast Asia, where deteriorating coral reefs have caused an estimated $3.7 billion decline in tourism revenue over recent years. Long-term projections in North America indicate that habitat degradation could reduce natural resource yields by over $4.5 billion in the coming decades. Business leaders and policy makers must prioritize sustainable environmental investments to counteract these quantifiable financial threats and ensure economic resilience. Biodiversity refers to the genetic, species, and ecological (ecosystem) diversity found among all plants, animals, and microorganisms inhabiting the earth's soil, water, and air. The basic needs of humans—such as food, clothing, shelter, and medical care—are sourced from a diverse array of plants and animals. The greater the diversity of species, the more stable and balanced the ecosystem becomes. A rich biodiversity is essential for sustenance, shelter, and overall well-being. Over the past 50 years, unprecedented changes in land and ocean use have been identified as the primary reasons for the loss of biodiversity and ecosystems. Human activities have altered three-quarters of terrestrial environments and nearly 66 percent of marine environments. For example, nearly half of the land in the United States that was once European settlements has been converted into agricultural land. In these transformed areas, yields are 70 percent lower than the national average. In efforts to increase production, a significant amount of biodiversity is being destroyed. However, it is time to consider the economic loss a country incurs by destroying biodiversity. Until we understand the importance of biodiversity to the economy, the issue will not hold significant weight for us. The extent of economic loss due to biodiversity loss in Bangladesh has yet to be determined. Although there have been several initiatives by the government, they have not met with success. The same scenario is observed in most countries around the world. Yet, some economic activities, while seemingly beneficial to humans, are causing significant damage to biodiversity, leading to various crises. These harmful activities are linked to essential sectors such as agriculture, energy, and fisheries. According to a recent report by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), activities aimed at short-term growth in these sectors are destroying biodiversity and escalating crises related to nature, climate, and human health. As a result, the global economy faces a loss of $25 trillion annually. The report warns that a lack of coordination in addressing crises is exacerbating financial losses. Biodiversity loss, climate change, water scarcity, food insecurity, and health risks are still being tackled separately. This not only increases the problems but also raises costs. For three years, 165 scientists have worked on this report, which indicates that industry owners are not considering the environmental and social damages incurred by their business activities. The overlooked costs range from $10 trillion to $25 trillion, which constitutes a quarter of the global GDP. The issue of biodiversity conservation gained significant attention during an international summit held in Brazil in 1992. The total number of species on Earth remains unknown today, and it is uncertain whether it will ever be known. It is estimated that between 5 million and 30 million different species inhabit the planet, with approximately 1.5 million species identified so far. Among these are 751,000 insect species, 281,000 other animal species, 250,000 flowering plants, 68,000 fungi, 26,900 mosses, 30,000 protists, 4,800 bacteria, and 1,000 viruses, among others. However, due to various reckless human activities, an average of 27,000 species is being destroyed each year. Scientists warn that if this continues, a quarter of all species on Earth could be wiped out by 2050. Important Factors to Consider in Assessing the Contribution of Biodiversity Before determining the economic contribution of biodiversity, we must identify the essential sectors from which we receive direct and indirect financial support. Beyond the sectors we can identify, there are countless others that quietly contribute to the national economy through biodiversity. NativeClick Ads The essence of biodiversity conservation lies in providing a safe environment for all living beings. Biodiversity is particularly reliant on water, soil, and forest resources. Life is unsustainable without water. All types of aquatic life, including fish, inhabit surface water. Water is a crucial nutrient, serving as the habitat for fish, which provide 20% of protein for 300 million people. When water becomes polluted, it means the habitats of aquatic life, including fish, are compromised. This is because a decrease in oxygen levels in polluted water makes it impossible for living beings to survive. For example, the Buriganga River, which suffers from pollution, has no fish or aquatic animals. Rainwater fills surface water bodies, with some of it seeping underground, providing people with drinking water. When water bodies are filled in, groundwater cannot replenish. As a result, the water table is dropping each year. During the dry season, many districts in the country face a drinking water crisis. All people on Earth depend on water, air, and food. In terms of livelihoods, approximately 2.6 billion people are engaged in fishing and agricultural production processes globally. About 80% of what we eat comes from agricultural products. Another major area of biodiversity is forests. Eighty percent of terrestrial species live in forests. Among 8,300 species of animals, 8% are extinct, and 22% are at risk of extinction. The livelihoods of nearly 1.6 billion people, including 70 million indigenous people, depend directly and indirectly on forest resources. Moreover, considering the oxygen produced by trees, all people on Earth depend on trees and forest resources. Trees also play an invaluable role in combating negative climate change. Of the 80,000 species of trees in the world, only 1% have been researched for their significant uses. Additionally, approximately 80% of people living in rural areas today use herbal medicines, which are primarily sourced from forest resources. Around 25% of the global population is estimated to work in agriculture. Estimating the economic value of biodiversity in agriculture and through the use of wild species for food is both challenging and controversial. Horticultural plant biodiversity can be highly profitable and provides opportunities for employment. In the UK, growth of ornamental plants was worth £1.7 billion in 2023. Biodiversity is a source of food, medication, and materials used in industry. It plays an important role in industry. It acts as a source of natural resources, materials, and products that are sold, consumed, or used in manufacturing. Recreation and tourism are also examples of human economic activities that rely on these benefits. In 2018, the WWF Living Planet Report argues that the whole global economy of US$125 trillion ultimately relies on nature. The benefits of biodiversity are often evaluated in an anthropocentric way and the inherent value of biodiversity, outside of its benefits to humanity, has been debated by economists. Despite these benefits, economic activities often result in harm to biodiversity, such as through deforestation. The majority of species have yet to be evaluated for their current or future economic importance. Raw materials, pharmaceuticals and drug production all directly and indirectly depend upon biodiversity. Impact of economic activity on biodiversity Even though biodiversity supports the economy, economic activity frequently degrades biodiversity, and since it offers financial incentives, it is frequently prioritized over conservation and restoration efforts. This adds to the worldwide decline in biodiversity, which has several causes, including overexploitation, pollution, habitat loss, and changes in land use. Boston Consulting Group (BCG) estimates that economic activities related to agriculture, infrastructure, fashion, and energy account for over 90% of the anthropogenic drivers of biodiversity loss. Furthermore, the IUCN estimates that mining, energy, infrastructure, and agriculture affect 79% of vulnerable species. It was projected that the loss of terrestrial biodiversity between 2000 and 2010 cost the world economy $500 billion. Long-term risks to society and the economy include an increased likelihood of pandemics, floods, and droughts due to ongoing biodiversity loss and environmental degradation. What Experts Are Saying: What We Should Do and What Solutions Are Available The Bay of Bengal is a blessing for Bangladesh. However, we are carelessly destroying this resource and missing out on the benefits of the marine economy. Biodiversity is crucial to the marine economy, which can be said to be the lifeblood of Bangladesh's national economy. Unfortunately, various factors are putting the marine life and ecosystem of the Bay of Bengal at risk. Instead of prioritizing the extraction of marine energy, we should focus on renewable energy sources such as offshore windmills. The government needs to pay special attention to developing wind energy management as part of its economic management expansion. Renewable energy is both cost-effective and sustainable, providing widespread and long-lasting benefits to the economy. Numerous organizations and institutions are fighting to protect marine habitats and wildlife. It is essential for everyone to be aware of marine life, as a significant part of the economy is tied to the marine sector. To protect biodiversity, all water bodies in the country must be safeguarded from encroachment and pollution. Necessary measures, including dredging, must be taken to enhance the water retention capacity of rivers and other water bodies. The use of all natural resources, including gas, electricity, and fuel, must be regulated, as water is used in their production. The use of tissue and paper should be limited. The sea, seabed, and coastal areas have become the largest zones for privatization. The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea granted coastal countries exclusive economic zones extending 200 nautical miles from their shores. As a result, one-third of the world's marine areas have been transformed into state-owned resources. This has primarily benefited colonial powers connected to remote island regions. France and the United States each received over 11 million square kilometers of marine area, while the United Kingdom obtained 6.8 million square kilometers, which is 27 times more than its land area. Governments in various countries have allowed private organizations access to marine resources. They have granted or sold private property rights in the sea. This has devastated the marine environment and reduced fish populations. Wastewater, chemicals, and plastics are being pumped into the sea. The extraction of mineral resources and tourism is destroying wetlands, mangroves, and other coastal ecosystems. Dr. Mohammad Taj Uddin, Dean of the Faculty of Agricultural Economics & Rural Sociology of Bangladesh Agricultural University, said climate change and human activities pose a significant threat to biodiversity in Bangladesh, similar to the situation worldwide. The adverse effects of climate change on biodiversity are evident in the vast areas of the Sundarbans coastal region of Bangladesh. Illegal deforestation and wildlife extermination, riverbank encroachment, pollution, deforestation, hill cutting, poverty, unplanned urbanization, water and air pollution, industrial waste, excessive use of harmful pesticides, and over-extraction of groundwater have all contributed to the current environmental crisis in Bangladesh. In light of this situation, urgent steps must be taken to conserve biodiversity in geological, aquatic, and marine environments. Dredging must be conducted to increase the navigability of rivers, and effective measures should be implemented for the proper execution of water agreements with India. Reserved forest areas should not be allocated for development projects. Development projects must be undertaken while maintaining a balance between development and biodiversity. It is essential to prevent indiscriminate deforestation and ensure proper management of protected forests. The public must be educated and made aware that forests and wildlife are integral parts of our lives. Professor Rashed Al Mahmood Titumir, Chairman of the Development Studies Department at Dhaka University, stated that past biodiversity targets have not been met. There is a need for several effective accountability mechanisms. First, there must be measurable quantitative targets. All stakeholders in society should know what percentage of land will be restored or how much pollution the government intends to reduce. Monitoring must include target-based milestones. Second, the state's understanding of life and ecosystems remains flawed, and there are significant gaps in the data. The quality of data must be improved. Ultimately, a proper accountability system is necessary. If world leaders wish to fulfill their commitments, this is crucial. The writer is a senior journalist"

Both countries described the meeting as “constructive” and confirmed a second round of discussions will take place next week - with the US hailing the “direct communication” as being key to striking a possible deal. President Donald Trump pulled the US out of a previous nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers in 2018, and has long said he would make a “better” deal. The talks are seen as an important first step in establishing whether a deal can be done. At two-and-a-half hours, the first meeting was brief, reportedly respectful - and set the stage for a second round. That was probably as good as it could get when Iranian and US officials sat down in Muscat, the capital of Oman - whose top diplomat mediated the primarily indirect negotiations. They were the most significant talks since Trump pulled the US out of the Iran nuclear deal of 2015 during his first term in office. The verdict of Iran’s lead negotiator, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, was positive. NativeClick Ads “In my opinion, as the first meeting, it was a constructive meeting held in a very peaceful and respectful environment, because no inappropriate language was used,” he told Iranian state TV. His diplomatic tone suggests the US team led by Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff did not reiterate some of the president’s threats that Iran would face “great danger” if this dialogue did not succeed. He has repeatedly warned of possible military strikes. This meeting ran with the delegations in separate rooms, relaying messages through Oman’s foreign minister, Badr bin Hamad al-Busaidi. Witkoff, who is leading the US delegation, had previously only spoken of meeting face-to-face. But Araghchi and Witkoff did speak for a few minutes in the presence of Busaidi – not the direct talks US officials said would happen but what could be a small but significant opening. Iran, mindful of pressure from hardliners at home, underlined how limited their face-to-face exchange was, with no photographs taken. In a statement following the talks, the White House said the discussions “were very positive and constructive”, noting that Witkoff had emphasised to Iran that he had instructions to resolve the adversaries’ “differences through dialogue and diplomacy, if that is possible”. “These issues are very complicated, and special envoy Witkoff’s direct communication today was a step forward in achieving a mutually beneficial outcome,” the statement added. Araghchi had said ahead of the discussions that his country wanted a “fair agreement”. After the talks concluded, he said discussions next week may not happen in Oman, but would still be mediated by the Middle Eastern nation. The White House said they would take place next Saturday. “Neither we, nor the other party, want fruitless negotiations, discussions for discussions’ sake, time wasting or talks that drag on forever,” Araghchi told Iranian state television."

""And I think something positive is going to come out of that,"" he said, touting his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping. These electronic goods are still subject to the 20% tariff on China related to fentanyl, White House Deputy Chief of Staff on Policy Stephen Miller posted on X. Some estimates suggested iPhone prices in the US could have as much as tripled if costs were passed on to consumers. The US is a major market for iPhones, while Apple accounted for more than half of its smartphones sales last year, according to Counterpoint Research. It says as much as 80% of Apple's iPhones intended for US sale are made in China, with the remaining 20% made in India. Like its fellow smartphone giant Samsung, Apple has been trying to diversify its supply chains to avoid an over-reliance on China in recent years. India and Vietnam emerged as frontrunners for additional manufacturing hubs. As the tariffs took effect, Apple reportedly looked to speed up and increase its production of India-produced devices in recent days. Trump had planned for a host of steep tariffs on countries around the world to take effect this week. But on Wednesday he announced he would implement a 90-day pause for countries hit by higher US tariffs - except China, whose tariffs he raised to 145%. Trump said the tariff increase for China was because of the country's readiness to retaliate with its own 84% levy on US goods. In a dramatic change of policy, Trump said all countries that had not retaliated against US tariffs would receive the reprieve – and only face a blanket tariff of 10% – until July. The White House then said the move was a negotiating tactic to extract more favourable trade terms from other countries. Trump has said his import taxes will address unfairness in the global trading system, as well as bring jobs and factories back to the US."

"science-technology","https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111648","Preventing global warm, carbon offset could be worthy alternative","13/04/2025","Carbon credits are one of the major pillars of most of the country's climate change strategy. Though many experts stated that, depending on offsets to meet emission reduction goals are mathematically impossible and a recipe for climate disaster. However, it serves as one of the most effective tools in the face of climate change. Since the Industrial Revolution, humanity has emitted over two thousand gigatons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The heat-trapping greenhouse gases have created a layer in the atmosphere, resulting in global warming. If we do not reduce global warming, the adverse effects of climate change—such as wildfires, heat waves, rising sea levels, floods, and droughts—will continue to escalate. To combat climate change, it is essential to rapidly prevent the emission of greenhouse gases. This includes increasing the use of renewable energy and halting deforestation. Controlling highly polluting gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide is crucial. However, these efforts alone are not sufficient to halt climate change. Scientists have stated that global temperatures must be kept below 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius, which is necessary to prevent the worst impacts of climate change. We need not only to reduce carbon emissions but also to remove and store some carbon from the atmosphere. In fact, most climate models suggest that by 2050, we need to remove hundreds of millions of metric tons of carbon dioxide annually while also accelerating the pace of carbon reduction. The 'carbon offset' method plays a vital role as an effective and natural way to remove carbon from the atmosphere. In this method, those who emit carbon in the atmosphere will fund others to remove that carbon as compensation. They will sequester carbon in the soil by planting or cultivating trees in regenerative practices or by using specific technologies. Carbon-emitting groups will finance the carbon-removing groups. How Carbon Offsetting Can Be Achieved First, by capturing and destroying greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere, such as methane gas capture projects at landfills. Second, by utilizing clean and renewable energy. This serves as an alternative to the greenhouse gases released from the use of natural gas. Third, through regenerative agricultural practices. This establishes a conservation and restoration process for food production, enhancing soil fertility, making the soil arable again, improving water flow quality, increasing biodiversity, and preventing soil erosion. Such agricultural systems can sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide in the form of carbon in the soil, which also contributes to soil fertility. In other words, carbon offsetting is achieved through carbon sequestration using this method. Fourth, another way to introduce carbon into the soil is through biochar. This is a type of charcoal made by burning organic matter such as crop residues, grass, trees, or other plants at temperatures of 300 to 600 degrees Celsius in the absence of oxygen. This process, known as pyrolysis, can prevent the loss of carbon from organic matter. Biochar is a stable form of carbon that cannot easily escape into the atmosphere. By preserving carbon in the soil, biochar increases soil fertility and reduces the need for chemical fertilizers. Fifth, certain minerals naturally react with carbon dioxide, transforming it from a gas into a solid substance. This process is commonly referred to as carbon mineralization. Naturally, this occurs very slowly, taking hundreds or thousands of years. However, scientists are discovering methods to accelerate the carbon mineralization process. In this method, carbon dioxide is introduced into suitable rocks or minerals, where it reacts to turn gaseous carbon dioxide into solid carbonate. Sixth, the use of carbon capture technology, or KMCIDR. This technology has been developed for capturing carbon dioxide from heavy industrial factories. Industries and power generation plants that burn hydrocarbons to produce electricity can utilize this technology. This method can capture up to 90 percent of carbon dioxide from flue gases emitted by power plants. This technology has the capacity to capture 300 kilograms of carbon dioxide per day, totaling nearly 116 million tons annually. Bangladesh has begun the journey Bangladesh has begun participating in carbon offsetting, primarily through initiatives like the Solar Home System, which have generated significant carbon credits. These credits are traded on international markets, providing financial incentives for reducing emissions. Bangladesh also has a target of reducing carbon emissions by 22% by 2030 and aims to source 30% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030 and 40% by 2041. Limitations regarding Carbon offsetting Despite being a useful tool, carbon offsetting has drawbacks. It should not be used in place of direct emission reductions because doing so alone may cause operational improvements to be delayed and high-emission activities to continue. The caliber and legitimacy of offset initiatives are other issues some may not produce the savings that were promised or may have unfavorable effects. Measuring and confirming emissions, guaranteeing the stability of carbon sequestration, and avoiding greenwashing are other difficulties. However, along with other preventive measures, countries should plan for this approach. Some countries in South Asia, including Bangladesh and India, and many countries in Europe have already taken plans and activities in this regard. Bangladesh also aims to reduce carbon emissions. Global leaders have reached a consensus to decrease greenhouse gas emissions to make the world more livable, aiming for net-zero carbon pollution by 2050. Bangladesh is joining this initiative. The government has implemented various plans and measures to reduce carbon emissions. Like many others, Bangladesh wants to move away from fossil fuel usage. Recently, the government has shut down several coal-fired power plants while keeping the ongoing ones operational. According to sources in the Power Division, no new coal-fired power plants will be constructed beyond the existing ones at Payra, Rampal, and Matarbari. This decision has led to the cancellation of at least two mega projects in Payra, one in Rampal, and three in Matarbari, along with one project each in Khulna, Munshiganj and Chattogram. NativeClick Ads When asked about the gains and losses from this decision, an official from the Power Division stated that there will be less coal burned. The demand for electricity will inevitably arise, and the government plans to meet that demand by utilizing clean fuels. As a result, carbon emissions will decrease. The government is placing emphasis on renewable energy. Brick kilns are significant contributors to environmental pollution, as they burn wood to produce bricks. This not only leads to carbon emissions but also increases pollution due to the removal of topsoil. The government states that alongside auto brick kilns, blocks will be produced to meet demand. Some factories for producing hollow blocks have already been established in the country. Experts estimate that using blocks will reduce construction costs by 30%. Additionally, homes built with blocks remain cool in the summer and warm in the winter, which will also lessen cooling and heating loads. There are approximately 8,000 brick kilns in the country, with 1,789 located in and around Dhaka. Dhaka alone has 487 brick kilns, which contribute nearly 58% to the city's pollution. Meanwhile, the government is also looking to produce energy-efficient appliances. The Sustainable Renewable Energy Authority has already begun working on star labeling. The aim of this project is to encourage the use of energy-efficient devices. In this context, Dr. Syeda Rizwana Hasan, an adviser to the interim government of Bangladesh, stated, we have taken several initiatives for carbon control. We are prioritizing renewable energy. Work is ongoing to modernize brick kilns, and we have also initiated measures to control vehicle pollution. What Experts Are Saying Climate scientist Dr. Abed Chowdhury states that removing carbon from the atmosphere and storing it in the soil is a crucial part of carbon offsetting. By measuring the amount of organic matter in the soil both before and after carbon storage, it is possible to determine how much carbon has been removed or retained. Based on the extent of carbon removal and retention, compensation can be sought from companies responsible for greenhouse gas emissions. He further explains that agriculture-dependent countries like Bangladesh can earn a certain amount of money by participating in carbon offsetting. They can even choose carbon offsetting as a means of livelihood. We believe there is nothing impossible for humanity. Those who once emerged from the interiors of Africa and conquered the world will now find a way to navigate through this crisis of global warming. Professor Dr. Zillur Rahman, director of the Disaster Science and Climate Resilience Department at Dhaka University, says that if we want to avoid negative impacts, we must adopt certain measures. In this case, reducing carbon emissions should be the primary focus. It is not enough to simply plant trees we must also decrease our reliance on oil, gas, and other fossil fuels that release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Industries need to establish environmentally sensitive frameworks. In developed countries, a carbon footprint assessment is conducted before any institution or building is constructed. Although we have building codes here, the issue of carbon footprint has not yet been addressed. Dr. Zillur Rahman adds that while green technology may be expensive, its implementation can be initiated in our country. Although it may involve substantial costs now, we will reap the benefits in the long run. When we are able to reduce the temperature spikes in the atmosphere, the entire world will adopt us as a model. The writer is a senior journalist"

"science-technology","https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111656","Need for ADR in Bangladesh","14/04/2025","Introduction: The term ‘ADR’ simply means Alternative Dispute Resolution, which refers to other methods that are available to resolve a dispute, apart from court proceedings these ADR methods involve arbitration, mediation, negotiation, etc. In today’s world, day by day, ADR is gaining widespread significance. However, people residing in Bangladesh still today, despite the enactment of the Arbitration Act 2001, do not properly comprehend the idea of ADR. Although slowly the justice system of Bangladesh will fully integrate ADR and people will have sufficient knowledge about it, the enactment of the Arbitration Act 2001 was one of the first steps, and mediation can be traced in the Family Courts Ordinance of 1985. Benefits of ADR: Before implementing ADR services or advocating the increased significance of ADR in Bangladesh, its benefits must be assessed. To begin with, ADR is cost-friendly this is because lower legal fees are associated with ADR methods. Also, since parties avoid court litigation, a huge sum of money is being saved, and usually parties going for ADR fully settle their issues, so there is no chance of appeal like in the court litigation scenarios, hence saving further costs. ADR services like mediation, arbitration, and negotiation are very time-friendly compared to litigation since a settlement can be reached quickly, also because of a smaller number of procedural delays, and these methods also provide flexibility. ADR maintains confidentiality and privacy, providing protection to secret and sensitive information of the parties for example, if a large business implements ADR like arbitration, their trade secrets will be protected as a result, and both their corporate and personal reputations are safeguarded. Unlike the hectic procedure of court litigation, ADR services provide a more relaxed environment for the parties that ensures emotional well-being. Moreover, when a party goes through court litigation, the ruling of the court can be damaging for one party however, ADR is focused on a win-win situation for both parties when resolving a dispute, causing minimal damage to both parties and saving their reputation in the long run. ADR also reduces the excess number of cases that go for litigation, which reduces the pressure from court, as unwanted or a huge number of cases can be solved through ADR. Why ADR is not implemented in Bangladesh: It is important to examine the people’s lack of knowledge when it comes to ADR in Bangladesh only a few businesses, certain legal professionals, and a few institutions know about ADR, but in general, people only run after court litigation. A lot of people in Bangladesh are unaware of the operations and functions of their country’s legal field hence, the concept of ADR is alien to them. Despite acknowledgement of ADR in Bangladesh via the Arbitration Act 2001 and the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act 2003, ADR still lacks institutional promotion, as it is visible that citizens do not know about any well-established ADR centres, which restricts the implementation of ADR services like arbitration and mediation also, no initiatives on such establishments are taken, for example, the Bangladesh International Arbitration Centre (BIAC) is not known by many and underutilised, although established in 2011. Another issue is that the litigants of Bangladesh do not communicate with clients about ADR this is because a lot of the lawyers themselves do not know about the advantages of ADR or do not fully understand the potential of ADR or do not talk about it openly due to lack of incentives, resulting in further slow popularity of ADR, making the court litigation busier with unwanted cases. Another issue that may be seen is that people do not trust ADR services compared to litigation this emerged probably because of the lack of knowledge they have about ADR, and so they do not want to explore ADR like arbitration or mediation and risk their complaints. Moreover, some enforcement issues can be seen as well, despite Arbitration’s arbitral award being acknowledged in the Arbitration Act 2001 the provisions that are found in the Arbitration Act 2001 and the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act 2003 lack appropriate enforcement, as there is no proper body in Bangladesh that maintains proper regulations of ADR services, decreasing the efficiency of such services and leading towards persistent delay. Solution and Why ADR Will Help Bangladesh: Fortunately, regardless of all these problems, it is still possible to make ADR popular in Bangladesh. First of all, a way should be figured out to promote ADR through court for this, the UK’s pre-action protocol, which is followed in civil claims, or something similar to the pre-action protocol, can be introduced. So basically, in the UK, before commencing litigation, both parties have to follow the pre-action protocol, and in this pre-action, courts highly recommend ADR, like arbitration, and if a party skips ADR unnecessarily, they get penalised by the court later. If something similar to this is introduced, the knowledge of ordinary people of Bangladesh about ADR will increase. If successfully, ADR is promoted in front of the general public of Bangladesh, ADR centres like BIAC will not be underutilised anymore, as they will be used more, leading to the government making investments for ADR centres or even expanding ADR centres from major cities to rural areas. This simple method will make the public of Bangladesh explore ADR, which will make them more aware of the system of ADR, and once they explore it, chances are they may like the system due to the benefits it offers thus, their trust in ADR will also increase. Moreover, the issue of lack of knowledge of lawyers can easily be countered by the Bangladesh Bar Council they can create a training certification program for lawyers on ADR, and they can also integrate a topic of ADR in bar examinations. For the new generation of lawyers, a subject of ADR can be added to their LLB program in universities of Bangladesh, like in India, where ADR has been added as a subject in the undergraduate program under many law schools and universities. A system of performance-based fees can be introduced for ADR so that lawyers do not think ADR is not worthy and advise the clients about it. If this is done successfully, it will mean lawyers will be trained in the field of ADR, so whenever one corporation goes into a contract with another corporation, of course they seek a lawyer’s advice, and since the lawyers of the new generation hold knowledge of ADR, they are likely to advise their clients to add an ADR clause to the contract, thus further promoting the system. NativeClick Ads Furthermore, the enforcement issue of ADR can be dealt with easily. This can be done by establishing a strong regulatory body for ADR in Bangladesh. Further, stronger rules and regulations can be developed, which can be done by strengthening ADR guidelines that can be maintained by the strong regulatory body for ADR this body can also ensure and improve transparency in arbitration. Even backup from court can be used for enforcement of arbitral awards, which is clearly mentioned in the statutory provision of the Arbitration Act 2001. This will mean court-annexed ADR, which is already available in Bangladesh through the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act 2003. Additionally, in order to bring more innovation and development in the system of ADR, all the nations that are implementing ADR or countries where the significance of ADR is increasing slowly can build a forum where ADR specialists from different countries can share their own experiences and ideas in order to promote ADR further and enhance the ADR services more this is highly beneficial since there is a growth of international commerce and businesses that usually go for ADR services like arbitration due to global enforceability, for being both time- and cost-friendly. In Bangladesh, there is an excess number of cases in court litigation as about 4.2 million lawsuits are pending in the courts, pressurizing the courts with a lot of cases due to the absence of appropriate ADR services as a result, many cases are pending for a long time. William Gladstone mentions, “Justice delayed is justice denied,” which has been the scene in Bangladesh’s judiciary because of the large number of cases justice is not being served in a timely manner, and justice is costly, so this is the time to give ADR an active role in Bangladesh. In Italy during 2010-2011 had a similar issue like in Bangladesh, at this time the number of cases that has been pending in the Italian courts rose to 5.4 million, for which mediation was made mandatory through Decree 28/2010, despite this facing resistance at first mandatory mediation obtained success as tens of thousands of cases was mediated since March 2011. Making mediation mandatory is not suggested, but if ADR can make a huge change in Italy, then Bangladesh should implement it to sustain a better legal system to make it better and relieve the pressure on it. Another example would be Canada, where ADR grew in the 1980s and 1990s and soon became effective. Canada’s Supreme Court in Hryniak v Mauldin mentions the rule of law can be upheld through proper access to justice and acknowledges the new adjudication methods. If implementing ADR helps countries like Canada and Italy to decrease pressure from courts and improves the quality of justice, then enhancing the legal framework of ADR will also benefit Bangladesh. Lastly, applying ADR in Bangladesh also upholds the constitution of Bangladesh. The preamble of the constitution of Bangladesh believes in the rule of law and access to justice for all the citizens, aligning with ADR services goals. Moreover, Article 27 of Bangladesh’s constitution ensures equality before the law, and Article 35 mentions, in respect of trial and punishment, both can be safeguarded via ADR methods. Conclusion: Peacemaker Kenneth Cloke, founder of Mediation Beyond Borders International, indicates that without disorder, no new world is created likewise, the legal system of Bangladesh has already gone through a lot of issues now it is time to heal it by proper integration of ADR, securing the future.

The Nobel laureate died in Peru’s capital Lima surrounded by his family and “at peace,” his son Alvaro Vargas Llosa, a well-known political commentator, said on X. Rumors of the writer’s deteriorating health had spread in recent months, during which he had been living out of the public eye. Vargas Llosa was a leading figure in Latin America's1960s literary scene. He continued to write novels and essays for decades, with his works being translated into many languages. Vargas Llosa was granted honorary doctorates, prizes and awards worldwide throughout his lifetime. The most prestigious award was undoubtedly the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2010, which the Swedish Academy awarded him for ""his cartography of the structures of power and his trenchant images of the individual's resistance, revolt and defeat."" ""We would be worse than we are without the good books we have read, more conformist, not as restless, more submissive, and the critical spirit, the engine of progress, would not even exist. Like writing, reading is a protest against the insufficiencies of life,"" said Vargas Llosa in his acceptance speech at the Swedish Academy in Stockholm on December 7, 2010. ""Good literature erects bridges between different peoples, and by having us enjoy, suffer, or feel surprise, unites us beneath the languages, beliefs, habits, customs, and prejudices that separate us,"" he added. In 2016, he became the first living Spanish-speaking writer to be included in France's Bibliotheque de la Pleiade, a venerable collection of universal classics translated into French, and he was elected a member of the prestigious Academie Francaise in 2021.

Last week, the RSF launched an intense ground and aerial assault on refugee camps surrounding the city of El-Fasher in an attempt to seize the last state capital in Darfur held by their rival, the Sudanese army. The two warring sides have been locked in a bloody power struggle since April 2023. This has created the world’s largest humanitarian crisis and forced millions to flee their homes. The UN said it had verified 148 killings between Thursday and Saturday, but warned the toll was much higher. Senior international officials will gather in London later to discuss the ongoing civil war in Sudan on the second anniversary of the start of the conflict. UN spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said their verification process was still ongoing and their number of those killed did not include Sunday’s violence. “Credible sources have reported more than 400 killed,” said Ms Shamdasani. At least nine humanitarian aid workers were among those killed, the UN said. NativeClick Ads The refugee camps that surround El-Fasher - Zamzam and Abu Shouk - provide temporary homes to more than 700,000 people, many of whom are facing famine-like conditions. In a statement released on Saturday, the RSF said it was not responsible for attacks on civilians and that scenes of killing in Zamzam were staged to discredit its forces. The following day, the group said it had completed a “successful liberation” of the camp from Sudan’s army. The RSF accused the army of using Zamzam as “a military barracks, and innocent civilians as human shields”. El-Fasher is the last major town in Darfur under army control and has been under siege by the RSF for a year. Sudan’s brutal civil war will enter its third year on Tuesday. UN Human Rights Chief Volker Türk called on all parties involved to “renew their resolve to take meaningful steps towards resolving the conflict”. (With inputs from BBC)"

The new budget must be approved by Congress, and lawmakers could decide to restore some or all of the funding the administration has proposed cutting.

BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir handed over the letter to the chief adviser at the State Guest House Jamuna on Wednesday afternoon. In the letter titled ‘Opinions and suggestions on some urgent matters to be done in the prevailing situation in the country’, BNP has mentioned the end of the Awami League rule and the ouster of the rulers through mass uprising in July-August 2024. In the letter, BNP mentioned that in the long 16-year struggle, more than 1700 opposition leaders and activists have been victims of enforced disappearances, more than a thousand have been killed, and more than 6 million leaders and activists have been injured, maimed, and harassed in cases of disappearance. In addition, more than two thousand youths, students, workers, and women and children have sacrificed their lives in the mass uprising of July-August 2024, and thousands more have been injured and maimed. The letter says that starting from the Great Liberation War, BNP has always worked for the welfare of the people as a leader or active partner in every struggle to restore democracy and human rights. To that end, BNP has supported the interim government led by Prof Yunus in taking over the governance of the state in accordance with the constitution to deliver the benefits of the July-August 2024 students-workers-people uprising to the countrymen and create a sustainable platform to fulfill their aspirations, and has assured full cooperation and continued cooperation. BNP expressed the hope that the people's long-standing expectation from Prof Yunus and the interim government led by him is to quickly bring the fascist party, their party government and associates under the law, prosecute crimes against the people and humanity, prosecute corruption and looting, and return the laundered money, ensure compensation and proper medical treatment for the dead and injured, contain commodity prices and improve law and order, and return state power to the people through a free, fair and impartial national parliamentary election. BNP believes that changes and reforms in the constitution, laws, rules and institutions are essential for holding a free and impartial election. In this regard, they will support any initiative of the government. NativeClick Ads In the letter, BNP termed both the theories of ‘development first, democracy later’ and ‘reform first, democracy later’ as wrong. They believe that development for all is possible only by strengthening and implementing the democratic system and for this, reforms in the state system, laws and policies are necessary. BNP claims that almost all the epoch-making reforms in the history of the country’s politics and economy have come from their hands. They mentioned the 19-point reform programme of Shaheed President Ziaur Rahman, the Vision-2030 of the country’s leader Begum Khaleda Zia and the 27-point reform programme of acting chairman Tarique Rahman for repairing the state structure and the 31-point reform programme announced with the opinions of other parties. BNP said that the ongoing process of reform is part of their declaration and they welcome any ‘reasonable discussion’. However, they do not support the strategy of depriving the people of their voting rights by wasting time for the interests of parties or groups concerned. BNP had earlier conveyed some of its concerns and suggestions to the Chief Adviser on November 21 last year and February 10 this year, but they stated that no discussion was held on those issues. In addition, BNP believes that the government's activities are being hampered by the fact that 764 officials who were discriminated against by the fascist government were promoted but not posted, and demanded their immediate posting. In the letter, BNP emphasized the 'coordination' in the statements of the state's chief executive and the government, and said that the recent 'exceptions' in this have 'worried' them. They want to have confidence in the Chief Adviser, but feel that the statements of some individuals and supporters of his government have created confusion and called for necessary action in this regard. BNP further said that the 'great responsibility' of restoring the democratic rights of the people has been entrusted to the Chief Adviser and they hope that it will be fulfilled as soon as possible. BNP called for an immediate announcement of a specific electoral roadmap with a view to holding the national elections by December. They also proposed to place the NID project under the Election Commission and quickly resolve the legal complications of re-delimitation of constituencies. At the same time, the BNP demanded speedy trial of those involved in the fascist party and their government, compensation and proper treatment for those killed and injured in the July-August uprising, improving the commodity prices and law and order, and withdrawal of false and harassing cases filed during 1/11 and the fascist regime. At the end of the letter, Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir urged the chief adviser to quickly complete the necessary reforms and end the confusion created in the public mind by announcing a specific roadmap for the national elections by next December."

Climate risk can certainly pose financial risks. But specifics matter and it is important to be clear about its magnitude, likelihood and timeframe. It reduces GDP, weakens economy. It also poses significant risks to financial institutions, leading to increased non-performing loans and reduced profits. Climate-related risks may manifest over varying time horizons, and are likely to intensify over time, especially if the global economy undergoes a disorderly transition. They can drive financial risks, such as credit, market, insurance, and liquidity risks. Economic models vastly underestimate the potential financial loss from climate change and the global economy could face a loss in GDP of at least 50% between 2070 and 2090 if nothing is done to curb emissions, a new report has found. Climate experts say that since the world is urgently trying to curb climate change, it is important to recognize the need for resilience against climate change while maintaining financial stability. The impacts of climate change have already begun to appear in various countries, and nations are taking steps to mitigate and adapt to these effects. Record-breaking heatwaves, devastating floods, and excessive rainfall are pushing global climate change into a dire situation. The environmental destruction caused by chasing economic growth is projected to reduce global income by 19 percent over the next 26 years. Environmental scientists’ research warns that without urgent action, the world could face financial losses ranging from $19 trillion to $59 trillion by 2050. New research from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research reveals that climate change will severely damage the global economy over the next 25 to 26 years. Developed, developing, and underdeveloped countries alike will suffer losses. Income will decline in North America and Europe, while South Asia and Africa will pay a particularly high price, despite their relatively small contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. The report also highlights the severe losses expected in the United States and the European Union. Since the Industrial Revolution, global temperatures have risen by more than 1 degree Celsius due to greenhouse gas emissions. Six years ago, the heads of two central banks issued a stern warning about the financial risks of climate change. Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, and François Villeroy de Galhau, ex-Governor of the Bank of France, issued an open letter sounding the alarm about the global economy. The letter warned that any company or industry failing to adapt to this new world would cease to exist. The letter was signed by the head of the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), a coalition of 34 central banks formed in 2017, of which the Bank of England is a founding member. NativeClick Ads In the letter released on behalf of the Bank of England, Carney and Villeroy de Galhau describe the “catastrophic impacts of climate change.” They note that the effects of climate change are already being felt worldwide, such as heatwaves in North America, storms in Southeast Asia, and droughts in Africa and Australia. These natural disasters are causing extensive damage to infrastructure and personal property, negatively impacting health, reducing productivity, and destroying assets. According to the European Economic Forum, in the coming days, climate change will undermine economic stability worldwide. Recent surveys and studies have expressed this concern. Over the next few decades, economic growth is expected to slow down in most countries around the world. A report by the human rights organization DARA, conducted some time ago on the impact of climate change on the people and economies of 184 countries, stated that by 2030, global economic growth could decline by 3.2 percent of GDP due to climate change. Recent surveys and research from various institutions, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank (ADB), paint a worrying picture of the economic damage expected from the negative effects of climate change in the coming years. A May 2019 report by The Economic Times warned that countries like the United States will face severe crises due to climate change. Without timely and adequate action, the U.S. economy could suffer losses of at least 10 percent due to its impacts. The report highlighted concerns such as crop failures in the Midwest, devastating wildfires in California, and infrastructure damage in the southern regions. It further noted that if this trend continues, the U.S. economy’s export and supply balance could be disrupted to a degree unseen since the 1980s. In 2018, scientists at Stanford University published a research report on the economic losses caused by climate change. According to their findings, if all countries worldwide manage to limit temperature increases to 2.5 degrees Celsius as per the Paris Climate Agreement, the global GDP would decline by 15 percent. However, if temperatures rise by 3 degrees Celsius, GDP losses could reach 25 percent. If no action is taken, temperatures could increase by 4 degrees Celsius by 2100, resulting in a 30 percent reduction in GDP compared to 2010 levels. The IMF has also expressed concerns that climate change could have a negative impact on the global economy over the next decade. The IMF report highlights that small island nations and coastal countries could lose up to 10 percent of their total economic growth due to climate change. In the context of the Paris Agreement, the IMF has warned of the potential negative effects of climate change on the global economy. According to IMF sources, nearly 80 percent of least developed countries and 50 percent of developing countries are at extreme risk from climate change. In this regard, in addition to Bangladesh, the economies of coastal Cambodia, China, Egypt, Guyana, Suriname, Thailand, and Vietnam will also face significant damage. Furthermore, if temperatures continue to rise, sectors related to agriculture, forestry, coastal housing, and tourism worldwide will suffer extensive harm. Moreover, nearly half of South Asia’s regions face the risk of declining economic growth over the next few decades. The World Bank report states that changes in temperature and rainfall patterns in this region will cause significant economic losses. The World Bank conducted a study assessing the economic impacts of climate change in South Asian countries, including India, and identifying which areas are most vulnerable by 2050. The report reveals that over 800 million people currently live in severe climate hotspots. Among South Asian countries, Bangladeshis living in these critical hotspots will be the most economically affected in terms of per capita GDP due to changes in average weather conditions. It further states that by 2050, their income could decline by 14.4 percent. In comparison, incomes in India and Sri Lanka are projected to decrease by 9.8 percent and 10.1 percent, respectively. According to a World Bank economist, there is a link between climate hotspots and water-scarce areas, putting 600 million Indians at risk of severe water shortages due to climate-related damages. Additionally, changes in the timing and amount of rainfall will adversely affect agricultural production over the next decades. All these factors combined will thrust the region’s economy into a severe crisis. Economic threats in South Asia become acute The primary reason for the economic threats in various South Asian countries lies largely in their dependence on geographic location, infrastructural activities, and natural resources of their economies. This reliance continuously disrupts the process of socio-economic development and economic progress. Although the economies of India and Bangladesh have moved from agriculture to production-oriented industries, a significant portion of their economies is still tied to the agricultural sector. Both countries’ economies remain heavily dependent on agriculture. In Bangladesh, agriculture is the largest employment sector. According to the 2018 economic survey of Bangladesh, it provides 40.6% of the labor force and contributes 14.10% to the national GDP. This sector's role in creating employment, poverty alleviation, human resource development, and food security in the national economy is undeniable. However, climate change is adversely affecting agriculture, the backbone of the country’s economy. Additionally, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), in its report on climate and economics, states that by the end of this century, Bangladesh’s economic growth could face a loss of 9.4%. The report forecasts the financial impact of climate change on six countries, including Bangladesh. Maldives and Nepal are the most vulnerable economically, with anticipated losses of 12.6% and 9.9%, respectively, by the century's end. Bangladesh’s loss is projected at 9.4%, close to Nepal’s figure. India is expected to face an 8.7% economic loss, Bhutan 6.6%, and Sri Lanka 6.5%. The report further notes that to combat climate change, South Asia must spend at least $73 billion annually starting now. Climate change poses a threat not only to the global economy but to all humanity. Despite various initiatives by different countries, global consensus remains elusive. Excessive carbon dioxide has already accumulated in the atmosphere if this is not curbed, what will be our future? However, there is hope as global awareness of climate change is increasing. Some countries are imposing carbon taxes to reduce emissions. China, Denmark, Germany, and Sweden have imposed carbon taxes on the meat, dairy, and poultry industries. Many countries are reducing fossil fuel use and increasing renewable energy consumption. Forest areas are expanding. According to the 2015 agreement, 195 countries have signed pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 26-28% by 2025. Yet, if the earth’s temperature rises by 2 degrees Celsius compared to the pre-industrial era, no further measures will be able to halt climate change. In other words, if we fail to tackle climate change, nearly all countries’ economies will plunge into severe crisis, and ultimately, we will suffer the consequences. Among the sectors directly negatively affected by climate change in Bangladesh’s economy, agriculture stands foremost. Its productivity entirely depends on temperature, rainfall, intensity, weather conditions, and seasonal variations. Key crops include food grains, rice, jute, wheat, tea, and mangoes. Rice is Bangladesh’s main crop. In 2005-06, production was 28.8 million tons. Bangladesh is the world’s fourth-largest rice producer. Despite rice and jute being the main crops, wheat has greater overall importance. However, climate change has adversely impacted this sector. According to agricultural information services, rising temperatures are causing a steady decline in rice production. Rice cultivation requires temperatures between 18–35 degrees Celsius. During winter, temperatures often drop well below 18 degrees, and during summer, they rise above 35 degrees. This causes difficulties in rice pollination and reduces yield. Rising temperatures cause polar ice to melt, increasing sea levels. Soil salinity in coastal agricultural lands is rising, further reducing crop production day by day. Researchers warn that if soil salinity continues to increase, agricultural income will drop by 21% annually, and 40% of coastal farmland will be at risk. This threatens the livelihoods of approximately 240,000 farmers. Besides rice, production of other crops such as jute, wheat, maize, peas, and chickpeas is also declining due to hailstorms, storms, sudden floods, and other extreme weather events. Per capita income is decreasing as a result. Moreover, excessive cold spells in the Rabi season severely damage crop yields. A significant portion of Bangladesh’s economy depends on fishery resources. Employment, foreign exchange, and even the healthcare sector rely heavily on it. Bangladesh has nearly 147,000 hectares of ponds, 5,488 hectares of baor (oxbow lakes), and 11 million hectares of shrimp farms. Additionally, about 4.47 million hectares of open water bodies (rivers, haors, beels, canals) are home to 250 fish species, including 24 species that breed there. This vast fishery resource is now threatened by climate change. Damage to this resource would severely impact the country’s economy. According to a research report by the international organization Germanwatch, climate change causes Bangladesh an annual loss of $2.189 billion, negatively affecting national growth by 1.81%. The report states that from 1990 to 2009, nearly 20% of the world’s climate-related losses occurred in Bangladesh. Moreover, with decreasing arable land and diminishing fishery and forest resources, Bangladesh’s main revenue sources are at risk. Reduced agriculture-based production will cause the government to lose a substantial portion of its revenue and export income. In such conditions, Bangladesh’s economy will struggle, with expenditure exceeding income. At the national level, Bangladesh faces enormous financial losses due to the need to combat climate change. Implementing the Bay of Bengal Island Plan, a technology- and science-based techno-economic mega-plan, will require about 2.5% of GDP by 2025. To prevent and manage various natural disasters, infrastructural designs must be modified and upgraded. For example, to prevent saline water intrusion, coastal polders need redesigning, repair, and new construction irrigation projects require reform due to changes in river flow and behavior. Moreover, significant budget allocations are required annually to repair or rebuild infrastructure damaged by successive natural disasters. If donor agencies refuse to fund these expenses, the Bangladesh government must cover them from internal revenue, causing fiscal deficits in the domestic market and hindering other vital development projects. According to the IMF, about 80% of least developed countries and 50% of developing countries face extreme climate change risks. Besides Bangladesh, the economies of coastal Cambodia, China, Egypt, Guyana, Suriname, Thailand, and Vietnam will also suffer losses. If temperatures continue to rise, agriculture, forestry, coastal housing, and tourism sectors worldwide will be severely affected. Additionally, nearly half of South Asia’s regions face risks of declining economic growth in the coming decades. Economically, Maldives and Nepal are the most vulnerable, with projected losses of 12.6% and 9.9%, respectively, by century’s end. Bangladesh’s projected loss is 9.4%, close to Nepal’s. What Experts Are Saying in This Situation Dr. A. K. M. Mahmudul Haque, Professor in the Political Science Department at Rajshahi University, states that it is estimated that climate change causes an annual loss of $1.7 trillion. This loss is feared to rise to $3.1 trillion by 2050. These figures are based on research that considers damage to assets, infrastructure, human health, and the agricultural sector. He notes that a study conducted on 163 disasters from 2001 to 2019 attributes the majority of these losses to relatively poor countries. One might then ask: what would have happened if Bangladesh had not suffered from the negative impacts of climate change? Would the country’s economy have shown any positive effects? To answer this, one must understand the nature of climate change in Bangladesh. The area of arable land is also declining at an alarming rate due to climate change. Dr. Haque explains that beyond its direct economic impacts, climate change has many indirect effects. For example, affected populations lose their livelihoods and migrate to large cities, creating overcrowding. It is estimated that by 2050, the number of internal climate migrants in Bangladesh will exceed 20 million. This rapid population growth in cities leads to severe problems such as traffic congestion. Moreover, if these migrants were able to sustain their livelihoods in their own regions, a sustainable flow would be maintained in Bangladesh’s overall GDP. Measuring how much an individual marginal farmer is affected by climate change in Bangladesh is quite difficult. In this situation, relying solely on international donor agencies to resolve the problem is not practical. Instead, strengthening domestic policies—such as developing indigenous technology, expertise, resilience, climate migration management, state initiatives to send and support migrant workers abroad—and ensuring their implementation may be the most effective way forward. Rafid Bin Islam, a young environmental activist and student of the Department of Mass Communication and Journalism at Dhaka University, says the effects of global warming are not only environmental but deeply intertwined with a country’s economy, posing a huge threat to development and prosperity. Labor productivity is declining, while healthcare costs are rising. Other economic sectors are also particularly vulnerable. Climate change plays a direct or indirect role in various issues, including reduced availability of raw materials for industries and shortages of skilled labor. For instance, inland waterway transportation is disrupted during the dry season, which is one of the main modes of transporting goods within the country. This not only poses a major threat to trade activities but also gradually reduces the popularity of waterway communication systems. He also said, the government must take well-regulated measures to reduce the damage caused by climate change. Western countries are already focusing on reducing carbon emissions. The Bangladesh government has expressed its commitment to climate change policies through initiatives like the National Adaptation Program of Action and the Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan. Rafid also said, to tackle this global challenge, the government must prioritize climate change on its agenda. In addition to taking state-level actions, the scope of the United Nations and other organizations must be expanded. By actively addressing climate change, Bangladesh can not only safeguard its increasingly promising economic future but also meet the challenge of protecting the livelihoods of millions of its citizens.

We need to overcome that hurdles.” The Chief Adviser made the comment when Pakistani Foreign Secretary Amna Baloch called on him at the State Guest Jamuna on Thursday. Acknowledging past issues, Baloch said Bangladesh and Pakistan must find ways to “harness the potential between the two countries.” “We have a huge intra-market potential on our own rights, and we should use it,” Baloch said. “We can't miss the bus every time.” She said there is the need for regular business-to-business (B2B) interactions between the private sectors of two countries and exchanging visits at all levels. In January 2025, a delegation of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FPCCI) visited Bangladesh and signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce & Industries (FBCCI). The Pakistan foreign secretary hoped that the upcoming visit of the country's Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar at the end of April would further boost relations between the two countries. NativeClick Ads Chief Adviser Prof Yunus said he always preferred closer ties with neighboring countries, including Pakistan, in the framework of SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation). He said Bangladesh and Pakistan should exchange more youth and cultural programs between the two countries to increase the people-to-people bonding. The Chief Adviser recalled his meeting with Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in New York on the sidelines of the 79th UNGA in September 2024 and in Cairo on the sidelines of the D-8 Summit in December 2024, saying that they were key in making progress in bilateral relations. He said Bangladesh and Pakistan will continue to work closely at multilateral and regional forums like SAARC, OIC, and D-8. Senior Secretary on SDG Affairs Lamiya Morshed and Pakistan High Commissioner to Bangladesh Syed Ahmed Maroof were, among others, present."

Citing examples, he mentioned that France and England fought countless wars for centuries, but joined hands in the Second World War. The US bombed Japan in the same war, but later turned the country into an ally, Azad said. He added: “The other day, we faced a question about whether Bangladesh is shifting its foreign policy to be pro-Pakistan. It did not surprise us at all.” There will always be some people who will rarely believe in Bangladesh’s independent identity, he said. “Our response was obvious. Irrespective of whatever happened in the past with regard to the country’s foreign policy, it will be a pro-Bangladesh policy from now on, driven by our own interest,” the deputy press secretary said. Distancing from one neighbour to keep another happy cannot be the foreign policy of an independent nation, he added. NativeClick Ads He said it took the interim government less than 24 hours to translate its words into action by reminding Amna Baloch, the visiting foreign secretary of Pakistan, the outstanding issues between the two countries, while at the same time agreeing to work together for mutual benefits. One of the emotive issues, of course hindering Bangladesh-Pakistan relations, is Bangladesh’s demand for an apology from Pakistan for the genocide and atrocities committed by its armed forces in 1971, Azad said. He said even many in Pakistan’s civil society, media, and intelligentsia believed that an apology would be an act of goodwill and grace, but the Pakistan’s Foreign Office and military bureaucracy were always opposed to such an idea, and thus a formal apology never came. Bangladesh also pressed for the issue of division of assets, which was a forgotten matter for the past regimes, who preferred disengagement to talks, the deputy press secretary said. According to an estimate, he said, Bangladesh has a claim of at least US$ 4.32 billion as of 1974. The estimate was based on assumptions with respect to internal capital creation, external debt settlement, and retention of external financial assets, he mentioned. He said Bangladesh has an additional claim of about US$ 200 million, which was donated by foreign countries/agencies for the cyclone victims of the then East Pakistan in November 1970. “The money was lying in the office of the State Bank of Pakistan in Dhaka before it was transferred to the Lahore Branch of the State Bank of Pakistan during our war of liberation in 1971,” Azad said. He said the repatriation of stranded Pakistanis was another issue that hindered the relationship between the two countries. In the past, he said, Pakistan only took back around 125,000 of its people, but some 325,000 are housed in 79 camps in 14 districts of Bangladesh. Azad said these are the issues that continued to remain as barriers in order to move towards a healthy and forward-looking bilateral relationship between the two countries. “And the best option to resolve the issues is obviously talks, and this is exactly what the interim government is trying to do”. “It has brought Pakistan to talks after long years and duly raised the issues while at the same time looking to explore trade and commerce potential for mutual benefits,” he wrote in his post. The deputy press secretary reminded that Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus, during his meeting with his counterpart Shehbaz Sharif in Egypt earlier this year, spoke about the need for resolving the outstanding issues, and on Thursday, while holding a meeting with Baloch at the State Guest House Jamuna, he reiterated his call. But, in the same meeting, Prof Yunus insisted on a sound relationship with neighbouring countries, including Pakistan, to tap the huge economic potential of the region, he said. “It is perhaps time for Bangladesh and Pakistan to move on and work together to resolve the past issues for future benefits,” Azad said."

The adviser said this while addressing a discussion marking Foreign Service Day-2025 at the Foreign Service Academy in the capital on Friday. “We have initiated efforts to enhance human resources, especially at our consular posts . . . I hope to achieve at least partial success in this endeavor,” he said. Hossain said around 80 percent of the challenges faced by Bangladeshi expatriate workers stem from domestic processes before their migration, while the remaining 20 percent occur in destination countries. “Yet, our missions abroad are left to deal with the entire 100 percent of the problems,” he observed, stressing the importance of addressing root causes at home to ease pressure on foreign missions. Despite limited manpower and logistical constraints, Bangladesh missions are providing services to over 10 million expatriates worldwide, he said. Citing the example of Saudi Arabia, the adviser said nearly 3.2 million Bangladeshis reside in the Kingdom. “How can 50 officials in a mission handle problems of such a vast number?,” he questioned. He urged that initiatives must begin in Dhaka to reduce the systemic difficulties facing migrant workers before they even leave the country. NativeClick Ads Calling for greater empathy among officials, the foreign adviser said, “Expatriates don’t go to missions out of choice. Most arrive in desperation. While a few may behave improperly, the majority come in dire need of support.” He urged officials at missions abroad to serve expatriates with utmost sincerity and dedication, recognising their significant contributions to the nation’s economy. Speaking to reporters after the event, the foreign adviser also addressed the Rohingya repatriation crisis, describing Bangladesh’s current position as a “dilemma.” He identified the Arakan Army, the rebel group who is now controlling most of the area of Myanmar’s Rakhine state, as a major impediment to progress. “The Arakan Army is neither a state actor nor an internationally recognised entity, so formal talks are not possible. Yet, a solution to the crisis is unlikely without engaging them in some form,” he said. Hossain stressed that despite the lack of recognition, the Arakan Army’s presence and influence in Rakhine make their role unavoidable in any comprehensive resolution to the Rohingya crisis. Foreign Secretary Md Jashim Uddin and several former Bangladesh diplomats also spoke at the discussion on different features of the day. Foreign Service Day is observed on April 18 each year, commemorating a pivotal moment during Bangladesh’s Liberation War in 1971 when a group of brave Bengali diplomats serving in the Pakistan Foreign Service first pledged their allegiance to the Provisional Government of Bangladesh. Their bold move marked a significant milestone in the nation's journey toward independence and laid the foundation for an independent foreign policy. The day symbolizes the courage, commitment, and professional excellence of Bangladesh’s diplomatic community in advancing the country’s interests on the global stage."

The event was hosted online by an international peace NGO, Heavenly Culture, World Peace, Restoration of Light (HWPL), with around 200 participants joining from 50 countries. Under the theme of Transforming Conflict through AI and Cultural Understanding, a key focus of the workshop was the growing impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on journalism. Discussions explored how journalists can responsibly integrate new technologies while upholding essential values such as accuracy, fairness, and empathy. The event also featured discussions centered on the recent publication, Peace Journalism Studies (2024). The journal highlights peace journalism’s potential to foster reconciliation and cross-cultural understanding, especially in regions affected by conflict. Case studies demonstrate how constructive reporting can help bridge divides and support long-term peacebuilding. In a congratulatory message, Mr. Berry Lwando, Director General of the Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation, remarked, “In today’s fast-paced media landscape, what we choose to highlight matters. Peace journalism isn’t about ignoring conflict—it’s about framing it in ways that invite dialogue, not division. That’s a responsibility we carry.” Hon. Noel Lipipa, Member of Malawian Parliament for Blantyre City South Constituency, also delivered his congratulatory message. “I’m inspired by the work being done to explore how AI and cultural understanding can help reshape how we tell stories and resolve conflict. The world needs more storytellers committed to peace.” In his article, Director of News, Sports and Current Affairs / ABS TV Radio in Antigua and Barbuda, Mr. Garfield Burford, underscores the importance of evidence-based reporting to counter misinformation. While AI can make journalism more efficient, he cautions that it also raises concerns about accuracy and trust. He emphasizes that ethical judgment and human empathy remain essential to the work of a journalist. Mr. Sijam Sinjali, CEO of Agleshwori Hills Development Trust in Nepal, discusses the role of peace journalism in encouraging non-violent conflict resolution. His essay explores the challenges and ethical responsibilities peace journalists face, and how technology may help support more informed, solution-oriented reporting.

Known as ""50501"", for ""50 protests, 50 states, 1 movement"", the demonstrations were intended to coincide with the 250th anniversary of the start of the American Revolutionary War. From outside the White House and Tesla dealerships and at the centres of many cities, protesters expressed a variety of grievances. Many called for the return of Kilmar Ábrego García, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Political protests are becoming more common in the US - the ""Hands Off"" demonstrations in early April drew tens of thousands in cities across the country. The most recent polling from Gallup suggests 45% of voters approve of Trump's performance in the first quarter of his term, which is more than the 41% who approved during the same period in his first administration. Still, it is lower than the average first-quarter rating of 60% for all presidents elected between 1952 and 2020. Saturday's protests addressed a number of Trump actions, including those by the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) - Trump's initiative to cut US government jobs and other spending - and the administration's unwillingness to bring about the return of Ábrego García, a citizen of El Salvador. Gihad Elgendy told CNN he joined the protest at the White House to criticise the deportation of Ábrego García. He believes Trump ""could easily pressure El Salvador to bring him back"". NativeClick Ads The protests were generally reported as peaceful, although Representative Suhas Subramanyam, a Democrat, posted a video on X of a man holding a Trump sign and pushing through a crowd to angrily confront him. Many demonstrators carried signs reading ""No Kings,"" a nod to the anniversary of the start of the country's revolution against English rule. During celebrations of the anniversary in Massachusetts that commemorated the battles of Lexington and Concord and the famous horse ride of Paul Revere, people held similar signs. There was also a 50501 demonstration in Boston on Saturday. ""This is a very perilous time in America for liberty,"" Thomas Bassford, told the Associated Press, while in Boston with his partner, daughter and two grandsons. ""I wanted the boys to learn about the origins of this country and that sometimes we have to fight for freedom."" Trump's popularity appears to be edging down, especially when it comes to the economy. When he took office in January, his approval rating was 47%, according to Gallup. His approval rating in a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll similarly dipped to 43% from 47% on Inauguration Day. In the same poll, only 37% approved of his performance on the economy, compared to 42% during inauguration. Earlier this month, hundreds of thousands of Americans gathered for the largest nationwide show of opposition since Trump returned to the White House. Those protests - which were larger than Saturday's - happened in 1,200 locations in all 50 US states."

Nuria Lopez, Chairperson of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in Bangladesh (EuroCham), said this. EuroCham officially launched on 3 December 2024 at the Hotel Radisson in Dhaka is a business initiative that is actively supported by the European Union Delegation and the EU Member States in Bangladesh. The Chamber will serve as a centre of excellence, promoting business relations between European investors and their counterparts in the country. Nuria Lopez, a Spanish citizen and Managing Director of Zalo Knitting Ltd, a leading entrepreneur in the export-oriented readymade garment industry, has been living in Bangladesh since the early 90s. The presentation of the Bangladesh Investment Summit-2025 is different this year compared to the summits held in the previous years, said Nuria Lopez. However, law and order situation, transparent bureaucracy, timely execution of orders at the grassroots levels, uninterrupted power generation, continuation of investment policy and repatriation of profits are also to be ensured, said Nuria Lopez. BIDA Executive Chairman Chowdhury Ashik Mahmud Bin Harun presented the business and investment potential of Bangladesh. NativeClick Ads Chowdhury Ashik Mahmud is working to turn the BIDA into energetic and robust organization with a vision to woo foreign direct investment (FDI), said Nuria Lopez. The Spanish entrepreneur also said that Pran-RFL Group, in collaboration with H&M Group and International Finance Corporation (IFC), has announced plans to generate solar power, to be used in the apparel sector, marking a significant step towards promoting sustainability within the country's vital RMG industry. The clean electricity will be purchased by Bangladeshi garment suppliers serving the globally renowned Swedish brand Hennes & Mauritz AB (H&M), The MoU sets the stage for piloting Bangladesh's first Corporate Power Purchase Agreement (CPPA). Supported by the IFC and led by Pran-RFL Group, this project will link several of H&M's selected suppliers to a newly-developed solar park. Oscar Garca Maceiras, CEO of Inditex, had signed a deal with Pran Group to set up a power plant that will help ease power crisis in the country. Bangladesh’s economy will be in deep crisis unless a congenial environment and uninterrupted production are ensured in the export–oriented garment industry, the largest earner of export earnings of the country, said Nuria Lopez, also former president of Spain Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Corruption, nepotism, mismanagement and plundering of the state wealth plagued the economy of Bangladesh during the last several years that will stage back under the prudent leadership of Bangladesh's interim government Nobel Peace Laureate Professor Dr. Muhammad Yunus, said Nuria Lopez. Nuria Lopez, a Spanish national who came to Bangladesh in the early 90s and set up the export –oriented garment industry in Gazipur, said the readymade garment industry (RMG) is the backbone of the economy generating some 4.00 million jobs directly and indirectly some 15 million jobs in the country. Bangladesh received its lowest net foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow in the past five years in 2024, as the country experienced political turmoil and economic instability. A sluggish inflow in the first half of the year, compounded by mass uprising, the subsequent departure of the Awami League government in August, and a volatile forex situation throughout the year, contributed by experts to a 13.25% year-on-year decrease in net FDI in 2024. According to central bank data, net FDI inflow amounted to $1.27 billion in 2024, significantly down from $1.46 billion a year ago. When asked why FDI declined in 2024, Mohammad Ali, managing director and chief executive officer of Pubali Bank, said that foreign investors lacked confidence in the year against the backdrop of sliding in the law and order situation of the country after the political changeover. He said, “We did not receive much foreign investment during the first six months of 2024. Then in July, following student-led mass protests, the government was overthrown in August and a new interim government took office”. “During that period, the country's law and order situation deteriorated, although conditions began to improve after December. Foreign investors generally lack confidence in such situations, which is the main reason why FDI in 2024 was lower compared to previous years.” Meanwhile, the interim government has a major task to ensure sound law and order situation as the past Awami League government transformed the country’s law enforcement agencies into ‘monsters’ over the last 15 years. The Bangladesh economy will suffer heavily provided the export-oriented garment industry, the largest earner of export earnings of the country, are being targeted by miscreants, said Nuria Lopez. Meanwhile, the Spanish entrepreneur has expressed his support to Bangladesh's interim government led by Nobel Peace Laureate Professor Dr. Muhammad Yunus. The interim government should ensure sound law and order situation and protect business establishments and businessmen to revive the economy, said leaders of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (JBCCI), International Chamber of Commerce, Bangladesh (ICCB), Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FBCCI) while talking to this correspondent. However, as the country is going through a transition period, smooth engagement and participation of the existing import and export houses in the country is also important to retain the economy on the right track. The economy of Bangladesh has suffered a massive blow during the student movement on quota system in the government job during the period of July, 2024. Managing Director of Zalo Knitting Ltd, Nuria Lopez said that the employment generation in the economy is important as some 20 lakh youths are entering the job market every year. The RMG is the labour intensive industry and the highly densely populated country like Bangladesh can’t sustain generating thousands of jobs. Urging the stakeholders concerned to extend cooperation to the Nobel laureate to carry out necessary reforms, the economy will require several years to overcome the loss centering movement and violence and laid emphasis on normalcy to run business. High economic disparity, corruption, nepotism, slow employment creation, Russia-Ukraine war, siphoning off state wealth out of the country by some corrupt persons have created a crisis in the economy, she said. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has praised Bangladesh's measures, taken by the interim government, to overcome economic challenges due to the recent turbulence and major floods. “In response to the challenging circumstances, the authorities' efforts to initiate adjustments, including continued monetary tightening and rationalizing non-priority capital spending are commendable,"" IMF Mission Chief for Bangladesh Chris Papageorgiou said. BIDA Executive Chairman Chowdhury Ashik Mahmud Bin Harun presented the business and investment potential of Bangladesh. Meanwhile, Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus recently urged the global investors to come up with their business in Bangladesh to change the world saying Bangladesh is the best place for investment. “Bangladesh is a country with crazy ideas to change the world...so we invite you to join that craft not only to change Bangladesh by your business but to change the world,” he said while addressing the inaugural session of Bangladesh Investment Summit-2025 at Hotel Intercontinental here. Prof Yunus said: “If you want to make a business with a purpose, along with the business we do, Bangladesh is the place."" Meanwhile, the recently concluded Bangladesh Investment Summit 2025 has yielded investment declaration worth Tk 3,100 crore, says Chowdhury Ashik Mahmud Bin Harun, executive chairman of the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA). He shared the information at a press conference at the Foreign Service Academy in the capital. The European Union Chamber of Commerce in Bangladesh (EuroCham) has laid emphasis on a collaborative and transparent approach to energy pricing reforms, voicing concerns over the recently proposed gas tariff structure by the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC). In a statement, EuroCham acknowledged the government's strides toward a sustainable energy future but warned that the differential tariff mechanism — based on industrial consumers' contractual timelines and gas connection status — could inadvertently hurt investor sentiment and industrial growth. According to the chamber, the newly-proposed model risks placing an unfair burden on new and expanding industries, which would face significantly higher gas tariffs than their long-established counterparts — despite operating within the same sector. “Fragmented energy costs across similar operations may erode Bangladesh's competitive edge and discourage both foreign and domestic investment,” said EuroCham, pointing out that the proposed structure comes at a time when Bangladesh is actively courting global investors. EuroCham echoed the concerns voiced by industry stakeholders during BERC's public hearing in February and backed calls for a more inclusive, consultative reform process. The chamber encouraged BERC to engage more deeply with both foreign and domestic stakeholders when crafting energy policies that impact long-term business planning. “Energy pricing must align with Bangladesh's broader goals of industrial resilience, energy security, and sustainable development,"" the chamber noted. Reaffirming its commitment to Bangladesh's development journey, EuroCham pledged to work closely with the government to shape policies that foster inclusive growth and a globally competitive investment climate. With energy reforms at a critical juncture, the chamber's message underscores the need for policy alignment that not only addresses sustainability but also nurtures the confidence of investors driving the country's industrial future. The cost of doing business is high that sometimes erode the competiveness of the local industries, said business leaders in Bangladesh demanding an improvement in ease of doing business to establish a conducive trade and investment ecosystem. The major challenges for the national budget for the fiscal year 2024-25 will be controlling inflation, increasing the foreign exchange reserves, exports, and the tax-GDP ratio, and bringing reforms in the banking sector. Global FDI amounted to $1.3 trillion in 2022, with nearly half being made in Asia. South Asia saw an overall 7 percent increase, but Bangladesh witnessed a decline. ""Additionally, the customs, tax and VAT systems have to be automated and if the National Logistics Development Policy is implemented, it will help cut the cost of doing business,"" said Mahbubul Alam, president of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Emphasis should also be placed so that the interest rate of bank loans does not go up. This is because if the interest rate climbs, industrialisation and investment in the country will be hampered. According to the latest United Nations Trade and Development report, global FDI amounted to $1.3 trillion in 2022, with nearly half being made in Asia. South Asia saw an overall 7 percent increase, but Bangladesh saw a decline. FDI in Bangladesh amounted to just 0.4 percent of the country's GDP in 2022 while the ratio was 1.5 percent in India and 4.4 percent in Vietnam. In 2023, FDI to Bangladesh snapped its rising trend. Central bank data showed last week that the country received $3 billion in FDI last year, a decrease of 14 percent from $3.5 billion in 2022. An analysis of the central bank data shows that Bangladesh received $1.57 billion in net FDI in 2021. Since then, net FDI has declined each year compared to the previous one. Overall, based on revised data following the BPM6 manual, the net FDI received in 2024 is the lowest since 2020. Data prior to 2000 was recorded according to the BPM5 manual, and therefore cannot be compared with the more recent figures. The central bank data analysis shows that of the net FDI received in 2024, $622 million came from reinvested earnings. In other words, 49% of the total net FDI for the year was reinvested earnings. In addition, $545 million entered the country as equity capital. Furthermore, $104 million came as intra-company loans. When asked why reinvested earnings make up a major portion of FDI, a senior official of the central bank explained, “The return on investment in our country is quite good. As a result, many investors choose to reinvest the income they earn from their existing investments. However, in many cases, investors face various obstacles, including a shortage of US dollars, when trying to repatriate their earnings. Consequently, they are often compelled to reinvest their earnings.” According to the central bank data, in 2024, the highest investment — $416 million — was made in the banking sector. Additionally, the textile and wearing sector received $407 million in investment. Sectors such as pharmaceuticals and chemicals, power, gas and petroleum, and food also attracted significant investment. Echoing Mohammad Ali, a deputy managing director of a private bank said, “When a new government comes to power, there is often a possibility of changes in various policies, including tax rates. The current government is a short-term one, so investors are waiting to see what kind of policy changes might occur once a more stable government is in place. This is one of the key reasons behind the decline in foreign investment.” In the second week of April, the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (Bida) and the Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority (Beza) jointly organised the Bangladesh Investment Summit 2025. Chowdhury Ashik Mahmud Bin Harunsaid that the investment summit successfully created immense potential for attracting both foreign and local direct investment. He pointed out that the summit drew 415 foreign delegates from 50 countries. The writer is a senior journalist"

The suit filed Monday is part of a feud that escalated last week when the elite institution rejected a list of demands that the Trump administration said was designed to curb diversity initiatives and fight anti-semitism at the school. President Donald Trump froze $2.2bn (£1.7bn) of federal funding and also threatened the university’s tax-exempt status. “The consequences of the government’s overreach will be severe and long-lasting,” Harvard’s president Alan M. Garber said in a letter to the university on Monday. The White House responded later Monday night in a statement. “The gravy train of federal assistance to institutions like Harvard, which enrich their grossly overpaid bureaucrats with tax dollars from struggling American families is coming to an end. Taxpayer funds are a privilege, and Harvard fails to meet the basic conditions required to access that privilege”, said White House spokesman Harrison Fields. Mr Garber said the funding freeze affected critical research including studies on pediatric cancer, Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. “In recent weeks, the federal Government has launched a broad attack on the critical funding partnerships that make this invaluable research possible,” the school’s lawsuit said. NativeClick Ads “This case involves the Government’s efforts to use the withholding of federal funding as leverage to gain control of academic decisionmaking at Harvard.” Aside from funding, the Trump administration days ago also threatened Harvard's ability to enroll international students. Mr Garber, who is Jewish, acknowledged Harvard's campus has had issues with anti-semitism but said he had established task forces to work with the problem. He said the university would release the report of two task forces that looked into anti-semitism and anti-Muslim bias. The prominent US university, located in Massachusetts, is not the only institution faced with withholding of federal dollars, which play an outsized role in funding new scientific breakthroughs. The administration has targeted other private Ivy League institutions including suspending $1bn at Cornell University and $510 million at Brown University. Others such as Columbia University, the epicentre of pro-Palestinian campus protests last year, have agreed to some demands after $400 million of federal funds was threatened. The demands to Harvard included agreeing to government-approved external audits of the university's curriculum as well as hiring and admission data.

The warning came days after Trump announced a 90-day pause on his sweeping tariffs on all countries, barring China. In the eight-point list, Trump mentioned currency manipulation - an accusation he has made previously on some countries for deliberately devaluing their currencies to make their exports more competitive while making US products costlier abroad. Another warning is about Value-Added Taxes (VATs) that are applied to imports but refunded on exports in many nations. The Republican leader also warned countries of dumping below cost, export and other government subsidies, protective agricultural standards, counterfeiting, piracy, and IP theft, and transshipping to evade tariffs. He also warned of protective technical standards, citing Japan’s ‘bowling ball test’ - a claim Trump made first in 2018. According to Trump, Japan uses a so-called “bowling ball test” to cheat US auto companies out of selling cars to Japanese consumers. “They take a bowling ball from 20 feet up in the air and drop it on the hood of the car. If the hood dents, the car doesn’t qualify. It’s horrible,” he had said. On April 9, Trump announced a 90-day pause on his sweeping tariffs on all countries, barring China - a move that had seemed nearly impossible. According to Trump, who had introduced the slew of tariffs to address the alleged trade imbalance with the US, over 75 countries had negotiated and not retaliated against him - which led to the pause. During the 90 days, a significantly reduced reciprocal tariff of just 10 per cent would be in effect, he said. A growing alarm inside the Treasury Department over the developments in the bond market was reportedly the only factor that made Trump hit a pause on his reciprocal tariff regime._NDTV NativeClick Ads"

The certificate released on Monday for the 88-year-old pontiff said the pope had fallen into a coma before his death on Monday morning. Francis died of “cerebral stroke, coma, irreversible cardiocirculatory collapse”, the death certificate said. It added that the first Latin American pontiff in the history of the Roman Catholic Church died at 7:35am (05:35 GMT) in his apartment at the Santa Marta residence in the Vatican. Just a day earlier, the pontiff made what would be his final major appearance as he greeted thousands of Easter worshippers from an open-top popemobile in St Peter’s Square and delivered a blessing through an aide. Francis had suffered various ailments during his 12-year papacy with life-threatening complications in recent weeks during a bout of double pneumonia, for which he spent 38 days at Rome’s Gemelli University Hospital in February and March. The death certificate added that Francis also suffered from arterial hypertension, multiple bronchiectasis and type 2 diabetes, ailments that had not been previously disclosed. The Vatican also released Francis’s spiritual testament – a written statement of faith – in which he said he wished to be buried in Rome’s Basilica of St Mary Major and not at St Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican, unlike many of his predecessors. Francis’s death marks the beginning of nine days of mourning called the Novendiale. NativeClick Ads His body will be dressed in papal vestments and placed in St Peter’s Basilica for public viewing before his burial. Daily prayer services and Requiem Masses will be held in Catholic churches worldwide and at St Peter’s Basilica during this time. The Vatican also enters a transitional period called the sede vacante or interregnum, during which power is handed over to the College of Cardinals, but no major decisions will be made until the papacy is filled.

""We are aware that poverty is not created by poor people. It is a consequence of an economic system where resources surge upwards, concentrating wealth ever more narrowly,"" he said. Prof Yunus made the remarks while delivering his keynote speech on 'Exploring the role of social business, financial inclusion, and microfinance in fostering sustainable development and economic opportunities for marginalised communities' at Earthna Summit, organised by Qatar Foundation, in Doha, Qatar.

""Today, I will share the firsthand experiences of the power of two interrelated innovative approaches of social business and microcredit that have uplifted marginalised communities in my own country,"" he said. In Bangladesh, the chief adviser said microcredit model showed that even the poorest individuals are creditworthy. By offering small, collateral-free loans, microcredit empowers individuals to build livelihoods, generate income, and lift themselves and their families out of poverty, he said. The Grameen Bank founder said microcredit has a strong track record of success, most notably through the pioneering work of Grameen Bank in Bangladesh.

The verified @Israel account on social media platform X published a message that read: “Rest in Peace, Pope Francis. May his memory be a blessing,” accompanied by an image of the Pope during a 2014 visit to the Western Wall in Jerusalem. The post was removed shortly after it went live. The Jerusalem Post quoted officials at the foreign ministry as saying that the pope had made “statements against Israel” and that the social media post had been published in “error”. Francis, who died on Monday aged 88, suggested last November that the global community should study whether Israel’s military campaign in Gaza constitutes a genocide of the Palestinian people, in some of his most explicit criticism yet of Israel’s conduct in its war with Hamas that began in October 2023. In January the pope also called the humanitarian situation in Gaza ‘shameful’, prompting criticism from Rome’s chief Jewish rabbi who accused Francis of “selective indignation”. Israel says accusations of genocide in its Gaza campaign are baseless and that it is solely hunting down Hamas and other armed groups. Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who leads a far-right coalition of religious and nationalist parties, has not commented on the pope’s death. Francis in 2014 visited the Western Wall, the most sacred prayer site in Judaism, and also prayed at a section of a wall built by Israel in the occupied West Bank dividing Jerusalem and Bethlehem.

The chief adviser said this while addressing a high-level roundtable titled ‘Social and Environment Challenges Around Forcibly Displaced Populations-The Case of the Rohingya’ at Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Doha on Wednesday. In his speech, Prof Yunus said prolonged stay of the Rohingyas poses enormous challenges to Bangladesh and making these Rohingyas frustrated. He observed that rise in criminal activities in the refugee camps in Bangladesh and attempts of illegal migration are clear signs of desperation among them. “If the problem persists further, it may affect the security and stability of the entire region and jeopardise development initiatives,” he added. Unfortunately, the chief adviser said international attention is gradually shifting from the Rohingya crisis due to various conflicts arising at different corners of the globe. He said Qatar can use its good offices to put pressure on Myanmar for starting repatriation of Rohingya people without any further delay. Given the renewed international geopolitical and geostrategic scenario, Qatar can strongly express their solidarity to resolve the issue and be proactive to engage the OIC countries to raise more funds and impose pressure on the international community to advocate for the repatriation of the Rohingyas, he said. The chief adviser said Bangladesh is currently hosting about 1.3 million forcibly displaced Myanmar nationals (Rohingyas), while 32,000 newborns are being added yearly.

The deal is reportedly in the works in advance of a planned trip by US President Donald Trump to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates next month, Reuters reported on Thursday. Top defence contractors such as Lockheed Martin, RTX Corp, Boeing, Northrop Grumman and General Atomics are reported to be involved in the supply of advanced weapons systems.

He made such comment in an interview with Al Jazeera on Sunday (April 27). Next national polls will be held within June 2026, Prof Yunus said in the interview with Al Jazeera’s ‘Talk to Al Jazeera’ event. He also said the timeline will depend on how many reforms all agree or disagree on. If the consensus is on a larger number of reforms, then it will take longer. “If we can focus on a smaller version of the [reform] implementation, then we will have an early election in December,” he said in the interview that was aired yesterday. “However, if the process takes longer, we go up to June, but we will not go beyond June,” he added. Yunus promised that the next election will be best ever election in the country’s history. Asked if the Awami League will be allowed to take part in the polls, Yunus said, “We don't know yet, they [AL] have not declared anything.” NativeClick Ads He said once the declaration comes, then the matter of the response from the Election Commission and other factors will arise. Then there are other parties who may say that under this law they cannot participate and so on, he added. Asked whether the “honeymoon period” for the interim government was over, Yunus said people think the interim government is still a good solution for them. “They’re not saying let the interim government go, have the election today… We have not faced any such problem of people saying that ‘hand it [power] over as soon as possible’,” he added. Asked about ousted PM’s claim that she is still the “rightful prime minister” and how the government viewed her presence in India, he said he had a meeting with Indian PM Narendra Modi during the BIMSTEC Summit in Bangkok. “I made it very clear that, okay if you [Modi] want to keep her that is probably not something that I can settle with you, but definitely while she’s there, she should not be talking because it creates a lot of problems for us. “She’s giving speeches to incite people inside of Bangladesh, and we have to suffer from that,” Yunus added. Asked about Modi's response, Yunus said, “If I recollect, he said this [India] is a country where social media is open to anybody. I cannot control that.” Asked if he thought India was offering Sheikh Hasina political cover, should she face justice back home, Yunus said, “We have already sent a letter to Indian government to send her to Bangladesh. They have not responded yet, but when the legal procedures begin and the court will give the notice …” he added. The anchor then said, “So let me get this straight you’re saying that Prime Minister Modi has told you we can’t do anything about her freedom of speech in a country India that has been accused of stifling freedom of speech and in no way have you been given any kind of guarantees that she will be sent back to face justice?” Yunus said, “no.” On Bangladesh and India relations, Yunus said, “This is one of the cases that we have to resolve ourselves … we understand what their legal situation is, what our legal situation is. But we are waiting for the legal notice from the court.” Asked if Yunus decided to visit China first deliberately before India and whether he was sending a message, Yunus said he was visiting countries where he would like to go. “I tried to go to India, but they didn’t respond to it. So, I went to China, and now I’ll go to Malaysia,” he said. He said he is visiting countries to revive SAARC. Asked if India has given him a cold shoulder, and is he now deepening ties with Pakistan as an alternative, Yunus said, “I will not say cold shoulder. It’s maybe a temporary thing… something we have to resolve together. I’ll not take this as a final thing, it’s not something long-lasting.” Talking about Bangladesh’s relationship with the Trump administration, Yunus said his government has a very good, strong, and warm relationship with the Trump administration. Asked if he saw the US as a reliable partner or was he being forced to choose between Beijing and Washington DC, Yunus said, “No this is not a question of choice, they’re all our friends. The USA is a good friend, China is a good friend, India is a good friend.” Yunus said that foreign governments are helping Bangladesh so that Bangladesh could get back its money laundered abroad."

The country also said that its forces had contributed to taking back Russian territory held by Ukraine’s military in the Kursk region. In a statement provided to North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) on Monday, the Central Military Commission of the ruling Workers’ Party said that the country’s leader, Kim Jong Un, had sent troops into combat alongside Russian forces as part of a mutual defence treaty between Moscow and Pyongyang.

"science-technology","https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111965","India taking preparations to attack Pakistan","28/04/2025","Since the horrific terrorist attack in Kashmir last week, the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, has spoken on the phone with more than a dozen world leaders. Diplomats from 100 missions in India’s capital have filed into the foreign ministry for briefings, officials said. But the effort is largely not about rallying help to de-escalate India’s dangerous face-off with Pakistan, which it accuses of having “linkages” to the attack. Instead, according to four diplomatic officials aware of the discussions, New Delhi appears to be building a case for military action against its neighbor and archenemy. Without naming Pakistan, Mr. Modi in a speech on Thursday promised severe punishment and the razing of terror safe havens. In an indication of how volatile the situation remains, the security forces of the two sides have exchanged intermittent small-arms fire across the border, Indian officials said on Sunday. One official said the exchange of fire had happened two of the past three nights, while a second official said it was three consecutive nights. In Kashmir, Indian forces have also begun a sweeping clampdown, arresting hundreds, as they continue their hunt for the perpetrators. NativeClick Ads Earlier, India declared its intention to disrupt the flow of water to Pakistan, whose irrigation system depends largely on upstream rivers. It also ordered the immediate departure of some staff members at Pakistan’s diplomatic mission as well as of Pakistani citizens visiting India. Pakistan, for its part, has said it will suspend participation in bilateral treaties, including one that affects the “line of control” demarcating the frontier between the two countries in the disputed areas where a cease-fire had held for several years. Anti-Muslim sentiment in India is also intensifying, with Kashmiri students studying in other Indian cities in particular facing widespread harassment and many of them feeling compelled to return home. Five days after the terrorist assault, in which gunmen killed 26 civilians, India has not officially identified any group as having carried out the massacre, and it has publicly presented little evidence to support its claim that Pakistan was behind it. The Pakistani government has denied involvement. In the briefings to diplomats at the foreign ministry, Indian officials have described Pakistan’s past patterns of support for terrorist groups targeting India, diplomatic officials said. The Indian officials have said their investigation is continuing, and made brief references to technical intelligence tying the perpetrators of last week’s attack to Pakistan, including facial recognition data. The lack of strong evidence offered so far, analysts and diplomats said, pointed to one of two possibilities: that India needs more time to gather information about the terrorist attack before striking Pakistan, or that — in a time of particular chaos on the world stage — it feels little need to justify to anyone the actions it plans to take. A military confrontation between India and Pakistan, both armed with nuclear weapons, runs the risk of rapid escalation that could be difficult to contain. But India is largely unrestrained by any global pressure to limit its response, and it has become quicker to flex its muscles in recent years as its diplomatic and economic power has grown. The governments of Iran and Saudi Arabia have spoken to the two sides, and Iran’s foreign minister has publicly offered to mediate. The United Nations and the European Union have called for restraint and dialogue. But major powers, including the United States, are distracted by other crises, and analysts say India is interpreting the expressions of support by many countries for its pursuit of justice as a green light for any measures it takes. Trump administration officials have voiced strong backing of India’s fight against terrorism. President Trump has said he is friendly with both India and Pakistan, while noting that they have long been at odds. But it is unclear how involved Washington will get in the current clash. Three months into his term, Mr. Trump has still not named an ambassador to India, a sign of where South Asia ranks in his list of priorities. Source: New York Times"

It was disclosed in the third quarter (Q3) unaudited financial statements of the company for the period ended 31 March, 2025. The report was published after reviewed and approved by the Company's Board of Directors in its 44th meeting held on Sunday (April 27, 2025). The report says, following the post pandemic impact and Russian's invasion of Ukraine, global economy continues to be weakened through significant disruptions in trade, food and fuel price shocks, all of which are contributing to high inflation and subsequent tightening in global financing conditions. Besides, the price hike of material, vulnerable global market condition and devaluation of Bangladesh currency against foreign currencies have increased material cost drastically and also higher inflation rate has been impacted on company's operating cost. In addition, VAT on the supply of refrigerator has been increased to 7.5 percent from 5 percent and also 7.5 percent VAT has been imposed on the supply of air conditioner under the Finance Act 2024. Due to increased cost pressures, the company’s operating profit margin during the July-March period of 2024-2025 declined to 22.09% from 24.73% in the previous year’s same period. In addition, the finance cost as a percentage of sales rose to 7.29% from 6.14%, driven by higher borrowing costs and devaluation of Bangladesh currency against dollar. As a result of these combined economic and political challenges, the net profit after tax for the period ended 31 March, 2025 stood at TK.696.44 crore and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of Tk 22.99 whereas in comparative period ended 31 March, 2024 the net profit after tax was Tk 762.34 crore and EPS was Tk 25.17. As on March 31 of 2025, the Company's Net Asset Value Per Share (NAVPS) stood at Tk 277.04 without revaluation and Tk 378.42 with revaluation. NativeClick Ads The Company’s Net Operating Cash Flows Per Share (NOCFPS) for the period ended 31 March, 2025 stood at Tk 1.83 negative, a decline from Tk 22.88 in the previous period. This decrease is primarily due to a strategic shift in working capital management, whereby payments to suppliers were made using collections from customers rather than bank borrowings. Furthermore, payments to suppliers for goods and services, as well as disbursements to the Government Exchequer for income tax and VAT, increased in line with higher procurement volumes aimed at supporting anticipated sales growth during the current and upcoming peak seasons. These strategic adjustments in cash flow management reflect our long-term commitment to sustainable growth and operational resilience, reinforcing our position in the market. However, the management anticipated that the company’s profits would be healthier in the last quarter (April-June) of the current Financial Year following the peak season of sales. Along with the third quarter financial statements, the Board of the Company also approved the Lithium-Ion Battery Cell Project. The primary objectives of this project are to develop a fully operational sophisticated manufacturing facility capable of producing high quality lithium-ion cells and reducing dependency on imports and providing a competitive, locally manufactured products. Commercial production will be commenced by the mid-2026. As a pioneer in producing lithium-ion battery cell, Walton will not only foster technological innovation and set a benchmark for quality and sustainability but also reduce reliance on imports, create new employment opportunities, technological growth and exports."

We are no longer dependent on the IMF and the World Bank (WB),” he said while talking to the reporters after two separate meetings on the Advisers Council Committee on Economic Affairs and the Advisers Council Committee on Government Purchase at the Cabinet Division Conference Room at Bangladesh Secretariat on Tuesday. He said IMF had acknowledged the macroeconomic stability of Bangladesh, including the stable state of foreign currency reserves and exchange rate compared to the situation in the last December. While divulging the outcomes of his recent tour to the USA attending the Annual Meetings of the World Bank and the IMF, he said that now in Bangladesh, the macroeconomic stability is far better as the IMF had also recognized it compared to the country’s condition in the last December. “Without receiving any further fund from the IMF, we’ve managed to make stable the foreign currency reserves and the exchange rate. We’ve ensured macroeconomic stability without their support and this is a proof,” he added. Dr Salehuddin said that the international financing institution would not be able to shoulder anything on the country. “They (IMF) told us that they will continue while they have also said that they are arriving to an agreement,” he added. About the upcoming project related support, he said supports are in the pipeline from ADB, the World Bank, NDB, and IsDB. “Regarding project support, we’re not apprehending any problem,” he added. Apart from separating the NBR, the Finance Adviser said that the IMF had earlier suggested for making flexible the foreign exchange market. “But, some issues are there to consider before making it wide open … since it is a major policy tool,” he said. NativeClick Ads He said if the foreign exchange market is opened fully, then the country can experience currency depreciation like in Sri Lanka and Pakistan. “But, we’ve told them that it is already stable,” he added.

During his meetings with the multinational companies in the USA, he said giants like the Chevron, Mastercard, said that Bangladesh’s economy is now more or less stable while they are looking forward to engage. “On the whole, there is nothing to feel sorry for Bangladesh,” he added."

In a social media post early on Wednesday, Attaullah Tarar accused India of using last week’s attack in Pahalgam, which killed 26 tourists, “as a false pretext” to potentially strike Pakistan. The minister did not provide any concrete information to back up his claim, and the Indian government did not immediately comment publicly on the allegations. “Any act of aggression will be met with a decisive response. India will be fully responsible for any serious consequences in the region,” Tarar said in the post on X. Pakistani Minister of Defence Khawaja Muhammad Asif also told the Reuters news agency on Monday that a military incursion by India was “imminent”. Islamabad is on high alert but will only use its nuclear weapons if “there is a direct threat to our existence”, Asif said. India’s Ministry of External Affairs did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Reuters news agency on the latest remarks from Tarar. Tensions between the two countries have been rising after India said there were Pakistani elements linked to the attack on April 22 in the mountain resort of Pahalgam. NativeClick Ads It was the deadliest attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir in more than two decades, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised to pursue the attackers. A statement issued in the name of The Resistance Front (TRF), which is believed to be an offshoot of the Pakistani-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, claimed responsibility for the attack. But Islamabad has denied any role in what happened and called for a neutral investigation. After the attack, the neighbours unleashed a raft of diplomatic measures against each other, including visa revocations and the closure of Pakistani airspace to Indian airlines. India also suspended its participation in the Indus Waters Treaty, which regulates water-sharing from the Indus River and its tributaries between the two countries. The move spurred protests in Pakistan, and the Pakistani government has said it is preparing legal action over New Delhi’s decision. Fire also has been exchanged along the Line of Control (LoC), the 740km (460-mile) de-facto border separating Indian- and Pakistani-controlled areas of Kashmir, prompting international calls to de-escalate tensions. On Tuesday, the United States urged the two countries to work towards a “responsible solution”. “We are reaching out to both parties, and telling … them to not escalate the situation,” a Department of State spokesperson told reporters, quoting a statement by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The spokesperson added that Rubio would speak to the foreign ministers of India and Pakistan on Tuesday or Wednesday and encouraged other foreign ministers to do the same. The United Nations also said Secretary-General Antonio Guterres spoke with Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Indian Minister of External Affairs Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and “underscored the need to avoid a confrontation that could result in tragic consequences”.

The Senate session also witnessed a call by PPP lawmaker Syed Masroor Ahsan, who endorsed the idea floated by the PTI seeking the involvement of PTI chief Imran Khan in the multi-party conference to send a “message of unity” in the country. The idea initially floated by PTI’s Ali Zafar was recalled by PTI’s Aon Abbas in his speech on Tuesday, in which he said PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif, PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari, and PTI founder Imran Khan should participate in the moot to send a strong message. PPP’s Masroor Ahsan, while endorsing the idea, observed that the government should show flexibility and listen to the opposition. “Both sides need to set aside egos,” he remarked.

He said he also spoke directly to the prime minister of Qatar. Mr Dar praised China and Turkiye for expressing clear support for Pakistan in the wake of the crisis. “I walked them through what happened — India’s psyche, its history and our concerns about what intentions it may have in light of that history,” he told the House. Mr Dar said intelligence reports suggest that India was contemplating some form of escalation. Referring to the 2019 Pulwama attack that killed 40 Indian paramilitary personnel and was blamed on a Pakistan-based militant group, the deputy prime minister noted that New Delhi had used the incident as a pretext to revoke Article 370 of its constitution, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir. The region was subsequently absorbed into India’s union territory framework, a move Pakistan has repeatedly condemned. Ishaq Dar also said that India had been attempting to alter the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, which determined the water-sharing mechanism between both countries, for the past two years, citing changing circumstances. “I have my doubts, much like other people, that this drama was staged to suspend this treaty,” he said while referring to the Pahalgam attack. He said there was no evidence that it was a false-flag operation. “What we do say with full confidence is that Pakistan has nothing to do with this [attack].” According to Mr Dar, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif offered an independent investigation into the Pahalgam attack fully knowing that Pakistan had nothing to do with it. He also made it clear that any meddling with Pakistani waters by India will not be tolerated at any cost and will be taken as an act of war.

Trump’s choice of Michigan was a recognition not only of how the battleground state helped propel him to victory over Vice-President Kamala Harris in last November’s election, but its status as a potential beneficiary of a tariffs policy which, he claims, will revive US manufacturing. But the cavernous sports and expo centre in the city of Warren, near Detroit, was only half full for the rally, and a steady stream of people left before the end of his disjointed and meandering 89-minute address. “We’re here tonight in the heartland of our nation to celebrate the most successful first 100 days of any administration in the history of our country!” Trump declared. “In 100 days, we have delivered the most profound change in Washington in nearly 100 years.” The 45th and 47th president falsely accused the previous administration of engineering massive border invasion and allowing gangs, cartels and terrorists to infiltrate communities. “Democrats have vowed mass invasion and mass migration,” he said. “We are delivering mass deportation.” Trump defended his use of the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 wartime authority that allows the president to detain or deport the citizens of an enemy nation, to expel foreign terrorists from the US as quickly as possible.

The press wing's statement was posted on its verified Facebook page - CA Press Wing Facts. The press wing presented the initiatives that interim government has taken to uncover the truth behind the barbaric carnage. Following are the initiatives: Investigation Commission On December 22, 2024, the government formed a seven-member National Independent Investigation Commission to reexamine the Pilkhana massacre. Chaired by retired Maj. Gen. ALM Fazlur Rahman, the commission has collected testimony from dozens of witnesses (about 37 so far, including officers, BDR personnel and victims' families). It has vowed to ""uncover the true nature of the incident,"" identify all culprits, and even probe any domestic or foreign conspiracies. On April 18, 2025 the commission issued a public notice asking anyone with reliable information or testimony about the 2009 carnage to submit it via its website or email, promising confidentiality. Pledge to Uncover Truth NativeClick Ads Home Affairs Adviser Jahangir Alam Chowdhury reaffirmed the government's commitment to a full reinvestigation of the Pilkhana events. In late February 2025, Commission Chairman Fazlur Rahman told reporters that the inquiry commission had already recorded evidence from dozens of witnesses and that it would call even top figures (e.g. then-Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and former Army Chief Moeen U Ahmed) as needed. He stressed that the investigation would ""uncover the true nature"" of the incident, include the real perpetrators in the cases, and examine all possible foreign or domestic plots. Public Appeal for Information On April 18, 2025 the Commission publicly invited any citizens or organisations with relevant information to come forward via its website or email. It highlighted the complexity of investigating a 16-year-old crime and assured confidentiality for informants. This suggests an official effort to be transparent and thorough, contrasting with claims that the government is covering things up. Court Cases and Releases In January 2025, hundreds of former BDR personnel were granted bail in mutiny-related cases. Contrary to Amir's allegation that they were set free with no legal procedures, the prisoners were released on bail. Families of the slain officers’ immediately protested that those who massacred army officers should not be freed wholesale. Meanwhile, survivors' families have filed new complaints (e.g. with the International Crimes Tribunal) and threatened fresh protests if justice is not secured. Victims' Memorialisation The interim government has simultaneously taken steps to honour the victims. In March 2025, the Cabinet Division officially declared Feb 25 as ""National Martyred Army Day,"" and accorded ""martyr"" status to the 57 army officers slain at Pilkhana. The press wing said Amir's affiliation with the Awami League is well known. In November 2023, she and her father, Barrister M Amir-ul Islam, collected nomination papers from the ruling Awami League for parliamentary constituencies Kushtia-3 and Kushtia-4, indicating active political engagement with the party. “Her family background is closely tied to the Awami League's legacy: her father was instrumental in drafting Bangladesh's declaration of independence and constitution, and the family has historically supported the Awami League. Although she has taken legal cases independently, she is widely seen as aligned with the party's political and ideological positions.” Given this affiliation, her recent remarks at the Geneva Press Club criticising the Interim Government and insinuating that it represents terrorists and mutineers involved in the 2009 BDR mutiny can be understood as politically motivated, the statement said. Notably, it said, Amir and other speakers at the Geneva conference did not cite any new evidence rather, they replayed claims (e.g. death tolls, indemnity laws, prisoner releases) that have circulated among opposition groups for years. “The Geneva press event is part of a diaspora-driven campaign to keep the spotlight on alleged abuses by Bangladesh's authorities and appears timed to capitalise on this attention and to project a narrative of government impunity to Western audiences. The timing coincided with the government's own steps (March 2025) to honour the mutiny's victims and call for justice,” the statement read. It claimed that Tania Amir and allies seized this moment to pitch a negative storyline that might resonate with international fears of militant Islam. The reality is that the interim government will continue to move on several fronts to ensure justice is finally done in this murky case that horrified Bangladeshis when it occurred and has divided public opinion ever since, according to the statement."

The government must outline its long-term and short-term reform plans, and draft a specific roadmap for holding the next general election only after implementing the necessary reforms. The necessary reforms could be reforms in the law enforcement agencies, the judiciary, and the Election Commission, he suggested. Then, the BNP senior leader referred to the ‘rumours’ that the interim government has granted a humanitarian corridor to Myanmar’s conflict-ridden Rakhine state for aid delivery from Bangladesh. The government did not inform the general people about such a sensitive issue, nor did it feel the need to hold consultations with political parties, which represent the people, over the matter. He declined to start a debate over whether the government can take such decisions without informing the public. But the decision must come from a national parliament elected by the people.

Air India, which has a 26.5% market share in India, flies to Europe, the United States and Canada, often crossing Pakistan's airspace. It operates many more long-haul routes than bigger domestic rival IndiGo. Data from Cirium Ascend shows IndiGo, Air India and its budget unit Air India Express had roughly 1,200 flights combined from New Delhi scheduled for Europe, the Middle East and North America in April. The move, announced by Pakistan is projected to increase operational costs by around Rs 307 crore monthly due to longer flight durations and higher fuel consumption. Air India expects to face around $600 million in additional costs if a ban from Pakistan's airspace lasts for a year, and has asked the federal government to compensate it for the hit.

In an interview with Russian state news agency RIA, Zamir Kabulov said the recent decision of the Supreme Court to suspend the ban on the activities of the Taliban was a result of “long and meticulous” work. “The Supreme Court's decision has removed the obstacles to establishing a full-fledged partnership with Kabul, including in countering the terrorist threat,” Kabulov said. He said Russia sees and appreciates the Taliban’s efforts in fighting the Afghan branch of IS Khorasan, the ISIS (Daesh) terror group's regional branch in Central and South Asia. “This group is a common enemy for Russia and Afghanistan, and we will provide all possible assistance to the authorities of this country through specialized structures,” Kabulov said. Asked if Russia is ready to officially recognize the Taliban government in Afghanistan, Kabulov said cooperation between Moscow and Kabul continued de facto, and the ban’s suspension has removed all obstacles for full-scale cooperation in various sectors. “The arrival of the Afghan ambassador to Moscow will put an end to this issue. We will officially announce this,” he said, adding that Russia has offered to increase the level of Afghanistan’s diplomatic presence in the country."

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and opposition leader Peter Dutton have cast their vote, ABC News reported. The voting will close at 6 pm local time (0800GMT). Earlier on Saturday morning, the polling began at 8 am local time (2200GMT Friday) where more than 18 million Australians are registered to cast ballots under the country’s compulsory voting system. The Australian Electoral Commission said 4.8 million had already voted early by Thursday. Ballots will be counted immediately, but results may not be declared on election night, especially in close contests. Postal votes will be tallied in the following days. The center-left Labor Party, led by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, is seeking a second term after securing a narrow majority in 2022. NativeClick Ads The main challenger is the center-right Liberal-National Coalition, now led by Peter Dutton. If neither bloc secures 76 seats in the 150-member House of Representatives, the country may again see a minority government, a scenario last seen in 2010. Half of the Senate's 76 seats are also up for grabs. Economic issues have dominated the campaign, with inflation, rising living costs, and housing affordability taking center stage. Political analyst Nathan Fioritti noted that both major parties have struggled to offer substantial solutions. “Support may shift toward smaller players like the Greens, who are proposing more transformative policies,” he said. Fioritti predicted a similar pattern to 2022 when Labor and the Coalition each secured roughly 30% of the vote. “There is growing frustration with the political status quo,” he said. Amid that backdrop, independents and minor parties, particularly the progressive Greens and ""Teal"" independents, could again become power brokers. Seven Teal MPs currently hold seats, having unseated the Liberals in traditionally safe districts by focusing on climate policy and transparency. Campaigns like the Muslim Vote movement are also targeting key marginal seats, especially in response to Australia’s perceived stance on the onslaught in the Gaza Strip. “The issue could influence voters sympathetic to the Palestinian cause, potentially affecting the formation of a minority government,” said Fioritti. While domestic challenges dominate, international concerns are also influencing voter sentiment. US President Donald Trump’s second term has brought unpredictability to global affairs, prompting voters to weigh which party could best manage the Australia-US alliance. Still, experts believe the Trump factor remains a background concern compared to economic matters. “Trump’s shadow is present but not central,” said Charles Miller from the Australian National University. On foreign relations, both major parties are expected to continue Australia’s strategic alignment with the US, while cautiously engaging China on trade. “A softer approach to the US is expected, regardless of the outcome,” said Miller. Voting in Australia is compulsory, with non-participation fined Australian dollars $20 ($13). Since its introduction in 1924, voter turnout has consistently exceeded 90%, making Australia one of the highest-participating democracies in the world."

The Sudanese Foreign Ministry confirmed the information on Saturday (May 3). A ministry statement said the attacks occurred over the past two days and accused the RSF of committing “crimes against humanity,” with the killings “carried out on an ethnic basis.” The ministry also reiterated its call for the United Nations Security Council and other international actors to end what it called “leniency” toward the RSF’s actions. Preliminary Committee of the Sudanese Doctors Syndicate, an independent humanitarian group, also confirmed the death toll of over 300, including 15 women and 21 children. The RSF has not yet commented on the allegations. On Friday, the RSF announced it had taken control of Al-Nuhood, seizing the headquarters of the Sudanese army’s 18th Infantry Division in the city after clashes between the two sides. The ongoing conflict between the army and the RSF, which started in mid-April 2023, has killed tens of thousands, displaced over 15 million people, and left Sudan facing one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, according to the United Nations.

The revolution it represents isn’t a moment in time—it’s a frontline that must be defended every single day,” he said. “The forces that opposed July haven’t disappeared. They are watching. Waiting. Preparing to pounce,” the press secretary said in a statement posted on his verified Facebook account on Saturday (May 3) night. He said it is now a battle between two visions of Bangladesh. One aspires to a democratic, free, and progressive nation, while the other is a kleptocratic, dynastic, Chetonazi regime clinging to the ghosts of its corrupt past, Alam said. “And make no mistake: the moment you relax, the moment you think the fight is over, they reappear—with violence, with propaganda, with venom,” he added. The press secretary said the anti-July forces have their “Laspensers”—those loyal scribes and spin doctors—eager to rewrite history and undermine July’s achievements. “They wait for the streets to empty so they can reclaim them. But I’ve learned: we must never leave the streets. Not just the physical streets, but the ideological ones too,” he said. NativeClick Ads Alam said the greatest challenge in any post-revolutionary moment is to defend the truth. “Because if you don’t, your opponents will gladly replace it with their fiction. Just look at the fate of the Biharis. Yes, some were collaborators during the Liberation War. But the vast majority were caught in the crossfire—massacred, marginalised, and silenced,” he said. He also said generations born in the Geneva camps now grow up in shame, denied the right even to tell their own stories. “That cannot be our fate.” “Wherever life takes me from here, one thing is certain: I won’t leave the streets. I won’t stop speaking about the massacres of July. “I won’t stop telling the truth about the long, dark years between 2009 and August 2024—a time of digital slavery, repression, and fear,” the press secretary said. He said the fight for a New Bangladesh is not just political but it is personal too. “It’s existential. It will shape the rest of my life. And I cannot, and will not, lose this fight,” Alam added."

The plan has already received an in-principle approval. Once sanctioned, it will be a shot in the arm for the force that has heightened vigil in the east following last year’s fall of the Sheikh Hasina government in Bangladesh and in the wake of a renewed challenge on the Pakistan front after the April 22 Pahalgam massacre. The BSF is soon expected to get the final sanction for raising 16 new battalions which will be raised over the next few years, sources in the security establishment told PTI. Some final approvals including sanction from the Union finance ministry are pending and are expected to be granted soon, they said. The paramilitary force has 193 battalions as of now to guard the two fronts. A battalion of the border force consists of over 1,000 troopers. Hence, the overall strength of the 16 new battalions will be around 17,000 personnel. These new battalions will help the BSF in its primary task of guarding the Pakistan and Bangladesh borders as per a blueprint being prepared by the border force, they said. The sources said two field command bases for the force have also been approved by the Union home ministry. One sector will come up in Jammu to strengthen security along the India-Pakistan International Border in Jammu and Punjab and the second will be based in Mizoram for better surveillance of the Bangladesh border, they said. NativeClick Ads The current sectors, headed by deputy inspector general (DIG) rank officers, in its Jammu frontier are located at Rajouri, Sunderbani, Jammu and Indreshwar Nagar. Under its Mizoram and Cachar frontier headquartered in Assam, the sectors are located at Silchar, Aizawl and one in Manipur. Sources said the BSF will initiate recruitment drives to hire men and women for these new battalions, followed by their training. The force is expected to raise these units over a period of five to six years, they added. According to officials, the 2.70 lakh personnel strong force had sent a proposal to the home ministry a few years ago to raise 20-21 new battalions owing to “the fast-changing security dynamics, profile of the terrain and related issues” in its primary task area of guarding the two borders apart from combat duties in the anti-Naxal operations theatre. The government finally agreed to raise 16 new battalions, they said. The BSF guards a total of 6,726 km of the two borders which includes 2,290 km of the India-Pakistan International Border and 339 km along the Line of Control (LoC) apart from 4,097 km of the front with Bangladesh. A total of around 1,047 km of these two borders is unfenced owing to those lines passing through riverine areas and harsh jungle terrain. The force has 1,760 border posts along these two frontiers.

""Allegations by the Rights and Risks Analysis Group (RRAG) published in The Hindu, that Bangladesh's Interim Government has targeted 640 journalists, are a wildly misleading piece of disinformation,"" it said. Since the Bangladeshis overthrew the brutal and corrupt regime of Sheikh Hasina's Awami League, many journalists perceived to have been linked to the regime have come under pressure from various quarters.

Director General of Inter-Services Public Relations (DG ISPR) has strongly condemned India’s latest aggression, labelling it a “cowardly and disgraceful” attack on innocent civilians. According to DG ISPR, the Indian Army violated the ceasefire agreement along the Line of Control (LoC) during the night of the 6th and 7th, resulting in the martyrdom of 31 civilians and injuries to at least 57 others. He said that instead of fighting Pakistan’s army, Indian forces purposely attacked innocent men, women, and children. He called this a cowardly act and proof of India’s lack of morals. DG ISPR also asked if the young children who were killed were the “terrorists” India claimed to be targeting. Highlighting India’s hypocrisy, he revealed that the Indian military also targeted mosques and even desecrated copies of the Holy Quran during the assault. “Which religion or principle of humanity allows the bombing of places of worship?” he asked. In contrast, DG ISPR confirmed that Pakistan’s response was strictly focused on military targets. The Pakistan Air Force displayed exceptional professionalism by destroying Indian military positions and aircraft, including three Rafale Jets, one SU-30, and one MiG-29, without harming civilians. He also revealed that the attack occurred while international media delegations were touring locations that India falsely accused of harbouring militants. “India launched this strike out of fear that its propaganda would be exposed,” he said. At the time of the attack, 57 commercial aircraft, including those from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE, China, and South Korea, were airborne in Pakistani airspace. India’s actions endangered thousands of passengers’ lives, violating international aviation safety norms.

Along with sustainable development, private organizations are coming forward in various ways for social welfare. Experts say that most private organizations are not only fulfilling their social responsibilities but are also genuinely committed to the welfare of society, a development that is highly encouraging for the country. Due to a lack of knowledge about technology and modern farming methods, many farmers in Bangladesh remain underdeveloped. The farmers of the country are lagging behind due to lack of knowledge about technology and modern methods. Despite working hard, they have to face losses. This has an impact on the rural society. Negative impact brings poverty. Addressing this concern, one of the leading private banks in the country, Standard Chartered Bangladesh, has taken initiatives in the northern region. Last year, the bank began training for 11,000 farmers across six districts of northern Bangladesh in environmentally friendly modern agricultural practices. Arranged through a local organization, the training took place in Bogura, Joypurhat, Sirajganj, Natore, Pabna and Rajshahi. Farmers were introduced to various modern farming technologies through this program. It not only increased productivity but also helped improve their standard of living. Several private initiatives are complementing government efforts to tackle the crisis of access to safe drinking water. Notably, the telecommunications company Robi has launched an impressive initiative to ensure the availability of drinking water in transit areas. Water plants have been installed at major railway stations, including Kamalapur, Dhaka Airport, Chattogram, Sylhet, Khulna, Rajshahi, Mymensingh, Mohanganj, Feni and Cumilla. These installations allow passers-by to easily access safe drinking water. Robi implemented this initiative in collaboration with Bangladesh Railway and the non-governmental organization WaterAid. This has particularly benefited homeless children and marginalized groups, protecting them from waterborne diseases caused by consuming contaminated water. Private efforts are also being made to deliver safe water to rural communities. Under an initiative by BAT Bangladesh, 48 out of 126 water purification plants have been installed in Kushtia district alone. These plants have been set up in Kushtia Sadar, Mirpur, Daulatpur, Kumarkhali and Bheramara upazilas. As a result, thousands of farmers and their families are gaining access to clean water, protecting them from waterborne diseases and arsenic contamination. In addition to ensuring safe water, BAT Bangladesh has also launched extensive tree plantation campaigns with the participation of local farmers in Kushtia. As part of this initiative, notable afforestation efforts have been carried out around the Lalon Shah Bridge, Kushtia Bypass Road, Kushtia-Jashore Highway and the GK Canal areas. Across the region, the impact of these efforts is visibly significant. It is worth mentioning that the organization has distributed over 130 million tree saplings across the country since 1980. Beyond safe water and environmental conservation, private initiatives are also working to ensure that farmers have easy access to credit. Syngenta Bangladesh is actively working to provide farmers with loans under flexible and farmer-friendly terms and is undertaking various initiatives for agricultural development. Simultaneously, the Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture is striving to bring long-term structural changes in the country’s food and nutrition systems. Professor Dr. Atikul Islam from the Department of Economics at Rajshahi University said, ‘The initiatives taken by private organizations for grassroots agriculture and environmental protection are certainly commendable. It is essential that their efforts are backed by thorough and appropriate research, ensuring not only benefits for the grassroots people but also long-lasting solutions to their problems.’"

According to Lt Gen Chaudhry, it was only after Pakistan had executed its retaliatory campaign under ‘Operation Bunyan-un-Marsoos’ that Islamabad responded to Indian overtures. “So on May 10, after the response and retribution […] and on the request and intervention of international interlocutors, we responded to the already made request of the Indians.” He also addressed viral claims circulating on social media about an Indian pilot allegedly being captured by Pakistani forces. “I want to categorically state that Pakistan has no Indian pilot in custody,” he said, attributing the reports to “social media chatter” and disinformation campaigns. “This is all part of fake news and propaganda that has been generated from multiple sources.” Highlighting the high stakes of escalation between two nuclear-armed neighbours, DG ISPR called the idea of war between India and Pakistan “inconceivable” and “sheer stupidity.” “In a conflict between two rival nuclear powers … such a conflict is actually an absurdity,” he said, adding, “In the case of India and Pakistan, such a conflict can lead to peril of more than 1.6 billion people.” He added, “In reality, there is no space for war between India and Pakistan, and if anyone wants to carve out this space for war, he is actually carving out the space for mutual annihilation.” Despite provocations, Lt Gen Chaudhry stated that Pakistan had acted with strategic maturity throughout the conflict.

The probe revealed that a powerful syndicate—comprising 11 international airlines, their General Sales Agents (GSAs), and at least 30 travel agencies—systematically manipulated the ticketing system, particularly on Middle East-bound routes. The nine-member investigation committee, formed by the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism, found that GSAs—especially those representing airlines of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, and Jajeera Air—established a monopoly over ticket distribution by Mr. Ahmed Yousuf Walid of Galaxy group who rule over at least 70% market share of Saudi Arabian points and middle east. By bypassing standard procedures, these GSAs facilitated preferential ticket allocation to select agencies, violating the permitted 7% commission cap and inflating ticket prices by 50% to 200%. The report further revealed that some travel agencies hoarded ‘block tickets’ and sold them through sub-agents at highly inflated rates. This artificial scarcity pushed ticket prices on the Dhaka–Saudi Arabia route to as high as Tk 1.9 lakh, even though the actual price should have been around Tk 50,000. The syndicate targeted Bangladeshi migrant workers—many of whom were forced to pay exorbitant prices to secure tickets for urgent overseas employment. The following agencies have been issued show-cause notices and summoned for formal hearings: Kazi Air International, Citicom International, King Air Aviation, RBC International, Mega International, Mother Love Air Travels, JS Travels & Tours, Sadia Travels, Hashem Air International, Naria Travels, Elham Corporation, and Al Ghazi Travels. Afsiya Jannat Saleh, General Secretary of the Association of Travel Agents of Bangladesh (ATAB), said, “Because of the GSA-controlled monopoly, legitimate travel agencies are denied access to tickets. Bribery and favoritism have become the norm. Unless strict action is taken, the syndicate will re-emerge.” ATAB’s complaints were among the key reasons the Civil Aviation Ministry intervened with emergency reforms. NativeClick Ads On February 11, the ministry issued a directive prohibiting ticket bookings without a passenger’s name and passport copy. As a result, many undisclosed block tickets were returned to the Global Distribution System (GDS), leading to greater transparency and a sharp drop in prices. Currently, ticket prices for the Dhaka–Saudi Arabia route have stabilized at around Tk 48,000 to Tk 50,000. Despite the exposure, critics argue that no visible punitive action has been taken against the syndicate’s masterminds. “Investigation and show-cause notices alone will not suffice,” said one stakeholder. “Without exemplary punishment, such practices will recur.”"

The Chief Justice made the observation on Tuesday during the hearing of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court on the appeal seeking restoration of Jamaat-e-Islami's registration. During the hearing, senior lawyer Ehsan Abdullah Siddiq represented Jamaat along with lawyers Shishir Monir. Lawyer Tawhidul Islam represented the Election Commission (EC). The hearing on Jamaat’s appeal originally began on 12 March this year but has since been deferred multiple times. On 7 May this year, the Appellate Division fixed 13 May to resume the appeal hearing on Jamaat's petition for reinstatement of its registration and electoral symbol. On 1 August 2013, the High Court declared Jamaat's registration as a political party illegal and void, following the disposal of a writ petition. Subsequently, on 7 December 2018, the EC formally cancelled the party's registration through a gazette notification. Jamaat later appealed the High Court verdict.

The prime minister accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal and Information Minister Attaullah Tarar. Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Syed Asim Munir and Chief of Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu were also present during the visit, the Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.

Though Afghanistan has not been in the radar of leading businessmen and exporters, small business leaders see the prospect of 100 million US dollars with the South Asian country in the next couple of years. According to available sources, the trade between Bangladesh-Afghanistan is hovering at some 30 million US dollars. Bangladesh’s export to Afghanistan recorded at $8.8 million (8858124.13 US dollars during the July-March period of 2024-25, according to data of the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB) Bangladesh ’s export to Afghanistan recorded at (10 million US dollars) 10164582.64 US dollars during the July-June period of 2023-24 fiscal year, according to data of the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB). Some 42 per cent of Afghanistan’s total exports go to Pakistan, 40 per cent to India, 4.00 per cent to China, 2.00 per cent to UAE and 2.00 per cent to Turkey, according to Afghanistan data of Afghanistan. Afghanistan, the landlocked country in South Asia, can offer the best quality of fruits to Bangladesh at the most competitive prices compared to countries like South Africa, Brazil, China, Australia, India, Pakistan and Egypt, sources said. Apples come from South Africa, Brazil, China, and Australia, pomegranates from India, pears from Pakistan, sweet oranges from Egypt, tangerines from China and India, and grapes from India, industry people say. Bangladesh roughly spent $450 million in 2021-22 fiscal year to procure fruits from the countries like India, Pakistan, Egypt, South Africa, Brazil, China and Australia, industry people say. NativeClick Ads Traders opened LCs worth $247.26 million in July-January of 2023-24 fiscal year, up 25.81 percent year-on-year, central bank data showed. The purchase from external sources was $196.54 million in the identical seven months of the previous financial year and $326.33 million in 2021-22. About 40 percent of the country's demand for fruits is met locally, while the rest comes from imports. Afghanistan exports dry food to Bangladesh through Karachi and Chittagong ports as the South Asian county is a land locked one. Afghanistan has the population of over 40 million and Bangladesh can penetrate in the Afghan clothing market, said a member of the Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA)). Sources said China has the largest penetration of clothing market in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, Afghanistan’s economy is projected to grow by 2.6 percent in 2025, according to the International Monetary Fund’s latest World Economic Outlook released this week. This forecast places Afghanistan near the bottom of regional growth expectations, reflecting both internal economic constraints and the broader global slowdown. The IMF’s global growth projection for 2025 stands at 2.8 percent, the lowest since 2020 and the second-weakest figure since the 2009 financial crisis. The report attributes this deceleration to heightened trade tensions, rising tariffs, and policy uncertainty, particularly involving major economies such as the United States and China. Within Central Asia, Afghanistan’s projected growth rate lags behind several neighboring countries. For instance, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan are expected to grow by 6.8 percent and 6.7 percent, respectively, while Uzbekistan is forecasted at 5.9 percent. Even Turkmenistan, with a projected growth of 2.3 percent, is only slightly behind Afghanistan. The IMF anticipates a modest improvement in Afghanistan’s economic performance in 2026, projecting a growth rate of 3.4 percent. However, this remains below the regional average and underscores the challenges facing the country’s economy. Afghanistan’s economic outlook is constrained by several factors, including limited access to international financial systems, reduced foreign aid, and restrictions on women’s participation in the workforce. These issues are compounded by internal challenges such as high unemployment, food insecurity, and a fragile banking sector. The IMF’s report emphasizes the need for structural reforms to enhance economic resilience. Recommendations include improving domestic revenue mobilization, fostering private sector development, and ensuring inclusive policies that enable broader participation in the economy. According to Al Jazeera in 2021, the U.S. freeze nearly $9.5 billion in assets belonging to the Afghan central bank and stopped shipments of cash to the nation as it tries to keep a Taliban-led government from accessing the money, an administration official confirmed recently. The official said that any central bank assets that the Afghan government has in the U.S. will not be available to the Taliban, which remains on the Treasury Department’s sanctions designation list. Taliban officials denounced claims that the United States could regain custody of Afghanistan's frozen central bank funds, warning that any such action would be ""unacceptable."" The Taliban-led Ministry of Economy issued the warning in response to the latest quarterly report released to the U.S. Congress on Friday stating that the government in Kabul is not recognized by Washington and has been subjected to economic sanctions. In August 2021, when Taliban insurgents retook control of the country just days before the withdrawal of all American and NATO troops, then-President Joe Biden froze about $7 billion in assets that were held in the U.S. by the Afghan central bank. Additionally, European countries froze around $2 billion. Washington subsequently transferred half of the frozen funds, amounting to $3.5 billion, to a newly established ""Afghan Fund"" in Switzerland. That fund is intended to support humanitarian assistance in impoverished Afghanistan while ensuring that the Taliban cannot access the money, but no payments have since been released. The remaining $3.5 billion was retained in the U.S. to fund potential compensation for ongoing court cases against the Taliban, brought by families of the September 11, 2001, attack victims. In August 2021, the United States withdrew the last of its troops from Afghanistan, ending its military presence there after nearly 20 years. Inflation in Afghanistan turned negative because of currency appreciation and subdued demand. In FY2024, annual inflation dropped from 10.6% to –7.7%, with food prices declining by 11.8% and prices for other items falling by 3.0% (Figure 2.14.2). Deflation resulted as the Afghani strengthened, reducing import prices demand was subdued and supply chains suffered fewer disruptions. The appreciation of the Afghani against key currencies, including the Pakistan rupee, Iranian riyal, and US dollar, contributed to lower domestic prices, as imports play a dominant role in the economy (Figure 2.14.3). Monetary policy continued to have little effect on prices. The merchandise trade deficit widened to 36.6% of GDP, reflecting currency appreciation and lower demand for minerals (Figure 2.14.4). In FY2024, exports dropped by 3.5% to $1.8 billion, mainly from reduced demand for Afghan coal in Pakistan and stagnant agricultural exports affected by currency appreciation. Merchandise imports increased by 13.5% to $8.0 billion. This reflected a 112.5% rise in intermediate goods and a 36.8% rise in consumer goods, fueled by private consumption, with Pakistan and Iran remaining Afghanistan’s largest import suppliers. The overall trade deficit in goods and services remained substantial at 42.4% of GDP, with imports rising by 12.1% and exports remaining stable Meanwhile, Afghanistan has one of the world’s lowest electricity consumption rates per capita. The country can generate only 20% of its electricity domestically, and barely one-third of its 36 million citizens are connected to the power grid. The remainder of its electricity is imported from Uzbekistan (40.5%), Tajikistan (24.0%), Turkmenistan (20.5%), and Iran (15.0%). The Afghanistan Power Sector Master Plan 2011 forecast electricity demand to rise from 2,800 gigawatt-hours in 2012 to 15,909 in 2032, with an annual growth rate of 9.8%. Peak demand was expected to grow by 8.6% annually, from 600 megawatts (MW) in 2012 to 3,502 MW in 2032. Actual demand in FY2024 was 1,500 MW, largely on track with the forecast. South Asia is one of the least integrated regions in the world in terms of trade and people-to-people contact. At present, regional trade in South Asia accounts for only 5% of estimated $23 billion in trade flow well below the potential trade of $67 billion. While the ratio of trade in other regions are East Asia: 50%, ASEAN: 26%, EU: 67%, NAFTA: 62%, LAC and COMESA 22%. Referring to the World Bank estimates, ICC Bangladesh reports Intra-regional trade now stands at just one-fifth of trade potential among South Asian countries. Meanwhile, India and Afghanistan held the highest-level talks since the Afghan group’s takeover of Kabul in 2021 in Dubai in January, 2025. The Taliban's foreign office said they saw India as a ""significant regional and economic partner"" after meeting with its most senior foreign ministry official, the highest level talks with Delhi since their takeover of Afghanistan in 2021. Against this backdrop, Bangladesh should explore and increase economic engagement with Afghanistan as the economy of the South Asian county is expanding slowly. In South Asia, Afghanistan's national currency, the afghani, is one of the strongest currencies against the US dollar. Currently, one U.S. dollar is traded at 72.30 afghani, compared to 69 afghanio."

But support from developed countries is lacking. Loss and damage, with progress being minimal amidst fluctuating interests. The wealthy world has created the climate crisis, while the poorer nations, which emit very little carbon, are suffering the most. Addressing climate change requires financing, yet as the UN climate summit COP29 approaches, there is still no sign of funding. Progress has been limited at the event held in Baku, Azerbaijan. Climate experts have called on countries to take swift, effective, and collective action. All negotiations at the climate conference seem to be stuck on the issue of financing. Despite much talk about money, the tangible outcomes are minimal. While affected nations strive to bring about change, they are met with resistance. As a result, environmental activists expressed their frustration throughout the day in Baku. Many placards during the protests echoed the term ‘greenwash’ which means misleading people by concealing the truth. Environmentalists lack confidence in the grand promises made by leaders from various countries to reduce global temperatures during discussions at the conference. Representatives from affected countries, including Bangladesh, have openly voiced in various forums and press conferences that developed nations are failing to fulfill their commitments. They argue that a handful of wealthy countries, having recklessly burned coal, oil, and gas for years, have pushed the rest of the world into danger, only to now stall on compensation. Many are skeptical about the intentions behind wealthy nations' efforts to involve private capital in financing measures to combat climate change. At the last 29 climate conferences, affected countries have demanded $100 billion annually, yet global leaders have repeatedly broken their promises. Many argue that these are developed countries, but what kind of development are we talking about? They are major polluters, historically responsible for severe carbon emissions. They are obligated to provide this compensation to help save the planet. However, this funding or financing must not be conditional in any way, nor should it involve loans or contracts. It cannot be used to impose carbon credits, new hazardous technologies, or seeds. This fund must be secured to support the climate adaptation efforts of Bangladesh's rural population, which depend on local and diverse approaches, as well as to compensate for overall damage. New funding raises concerns At the COP29 conference, wealthy countries, including the European Union and the United States, have agreed to provide $300 billion annually to climate funds by 2035. The conference, originally scheduled to conclude on November 22, 2024, has been extended to November 23 due to protracted discussions among 200 nations. These lengthy negotiations aim to finalize a global climate fund plan for the next decade based on consensus. On November 22, a draft agreement for a $250 billion fund was proposed at the COP29 conference, chaired by Azerbaijan. However, developing nations rejected this amount as ‘offensively low’. The current proposal is intended to succeed the $100 billion funding commitment set to expire in 2025. However, discussions are ongoing not only about the total amount of funding but also about who will contribute and how much of it will be in the form of grants. Nonetheless, a comprehensive outcome has yet to be achieved, leaving various countries in a state of concern. Several wealthy countries, including the European Union, have suggested that other economically powerful nations, such as China and oil-rich Gulf states, should also be included in funding contributions. NativeClick Ads Meanwhile, developing countries argue that inadequate funding will hinder their ability to set ambitious targets for reducing carbon emissions. A group of developing nations has threatened to withdraw from the discussions if a final decision on the proposal is not reached. In order to address the increasing pressures from climate change-related damages, developing countries have been calling for an increase in funding. If wealthy nations fail to fulfill their commitments through this proposal, divisions in future climate conferences may deepen further. What constitutes loss and damage resulting from climate change? The consequences of climate change manifest as increasingly frequent and severe floods, heatwaves, storms, and rising sea levels. While some individuals can adapt to these environmental changes, there are numerous situations where adaptation is not feasible: lives are lost, protective barriers are breached, land becomes unproductive, habitats undergo irreversible changes, and livestock perish. The unavoidable social and economic repercussions of climate change are termed ""loss and damage."" Loss and damage can be categorized into economic and non-economic types. Economic losses encompass financial detriments experienced by businesses, such as the significant heatwaves in India that have led to decreased wheat yields, adversely impacting the livelihoods of numerous farmers. This category also includes the destruction of property and infrastructure, exemplified by homes being swept away in increasingly severe floods. Non-economic loss and damage may involve the tragic loss of lives, as well as the erosion of cultural traditions, indigenous knowledge, biodiversity, and essential ecosystem services. What is the impact of loss and damage on Bangladesh and South Asia? From 2019 to 2023, approximately 82.1 million individuals were affected by weather-related disasters in South Asia, as reported by the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters. In 2022, South Asia accounted for the majority of natural disaster-related fatalities in Asia, largely due to the ""unprecedented"" floods in Pakistan that year, which impacted an estimated 33 million people. Numerous reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have highlighted South Asia's heightened vulnerability to extreme weather events. As global temperatures rise, the frequency and intensity of such disasters are expected to increase, potentially leading to significant loss and damage for the South Asian region. Considering the significant economic and humanitarian consequences of these changes, the methods by which the world assesses and compensates for loss and damage are critically important for the future of South Asia and all developing nations. With lives and livelihoods on the line, countries in this region and beyond are advocating for meaningful global discussions on loss and damage to facilitate their recovery and prepare for future challenges. What level of loss and damage will South Asia endure due to climate change? A study published in Nature in April 2024 projected that South Asia could face a median income reduction of 22% by 2050 as a result of climate change effects. Additionally, a 2018 study conducted by Australia’s Crawford School of Public Policy estimated that a 3°C increase in global temperatures above pre-industrial levels could lead to a 2.1% decline in India’s GDP by 2037, escalating to 5.5% by 2067. As of 2022, nearly 65% of South Asians resided in rural areas reliant on agriculture, which constitutes 18% of the region's gross domestic product (GDP) and accounts for 42% of total employment. However, agriculture is significantly impacted by climate change, affecting crop yields, exacerbating market prices, and heightening regional food insecurity. A pivotal 2022 IPCC report on climate impacts highlighted those economic losses from floods, cyclones, and heatwaves, along with gradual crises such as diminishing agricultural productivity, would have a profound effect on South Asia. It is important to note that South Asia is already incurring substantial costs due to extreme weather events. A study by the NGO Germanwatch ranked India as the seventh most affected country by extreme weather in 2019, reporting that severe floods that year resulted in approximately USD 10 billion in damages, claiming 1,800 lives and displacing around 1.8 million individuals. Each year, Bangladesh and other South Asian nations also endure significant destruction from tropical cyclones. Although advancements in weather forecasting have considerably decreased the loss of life, homes and livelihoods are consistently devastated with each storm. Super cyclone Amphan, which struck India and Bangladesh in 2020, resulted in estimated losses of around USD 14 billion, displacing 2.4 million individuals in India and 2.5 million in Bangladesh. Four years later, cyclone Remal impacted the same area, leading to damages estimated at approximately USD 600 million, affecting sectors such as fisheries, housing, and infrastructure. As climate change progresses, such extreme weather events are expected to become increasingly severe and unpredictable, complicating the ability of meteorologists to provide timely warnings as storms form. A 2019 study, using 2005 price levels, projected that climate change-related loss and damage could cost South Asia USD 518 billion by 2050, with estimates potentially rising to USD 997 billion by 2070. Climate change threatens lives and futures of over 19 million children in Bangladesh. Photo Source Unicef Why is loss and damage a contentious topic? Loss and damage have emerged as a divisive issue in international climate discussions, primarily due to concerns regarding liability and compensation. Developed nations, which have historically contributed the most to greenhouse gas emissions since the industrial revolution, have been hesitant to agree to any international framework that could obligate them to compensate for the losses and damages caused by their emissions. In principle, such an agreement was established in 2023 during the UN’s annual climate change COP (Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change). Held in Dubai, COP28 saw the establishment and funding of a loss and damage fund. However, the initial financial commitments represented less than 0.2% of the total annual losses faced by developing countries. What does the Paris Agreement state regarding loss and damage? Article 8 of the Paris Agreement, which was signed in 2015 at COP21, addresses loss and damage. It emphasizes that the countries that are parties to the agreement acknowledge “the importance of averting, minimizing, and addressing loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change,” and they are encouraged to enhance collaboration in implementing effective solutions. The incorporation of specific language regarding loss and damage in the Paris Agreement provided a formal acknowledgment that developing nations had advocated for however, the manner in which it was articulated favored the interests of developed countries. Paragraph 52 of the decision accompanying the Paris Agreement clearly states: “Article 8 of the Agreement does not involve or provide a basis for any liability or compensation.” Consequently, the Paris Agreement does not impose any legally binding responsibilities on nations to tackle loss and damage related to climate change, nor does it specify any financial obligations to assist countries experiencing significant loss and damage. What is the extent of funding allocated for loss and damage? As the United Nations gradually works towards establishing a sufficient loss and damage fund, some independent initiatives have emerged to aid vulnerable nations. In 2021, a coalition of philanthropic organizations, spearheaded by the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, contributed USD 3 million towards a loss and damage finance facility. Additionally, during COP26 that same year, the Wallonia region of Belgium committed EUR 1 million (approximately USD 1.1 million), while Scotland, the host nation, pledged GBP 2 million (around USD 2.6 million). Nevertheless, these contributions are minimal compared to the projected financial needs. The 2019 publication, Loss and Damage from Climate Change, estimates that developing countries will require between USD 290 billion and USD 580 billion annually by 2030 to address loss and damage. This estimate, co-edited by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria and the London School of Economics, is based on 2005 price levels and reflects a broad range due to various potential emissions-reduction scenarios. Is the establishment of a sufficient loss and damage fund feasible? At COP28 in Dubai, developed nations pledged approximately USD 700 million towards the new loss and damage fund. This commitment included contributions from the United Arab Emirates, Germany, Italy, France, Japan, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Slovenia, the European Union, and the United States. This amount represents less than 1% of the projected USD 400 billion that developing nations need annually to address the losses and damages resulting from climate change. In light of this inadequate advancement, specialists from the Global South have started advocating for greater ambition through the New Collective Quantified Goal. Should this initiative gain traction in upcoming climate change conferences and negotiations, it has the potential to deliver a minimum of USD 1 trillion each year to developing countries, offered as grants and concessional financing. Looking forward to COP 30 The Government of Brazil will host the thirtieth Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC (COP 30), with a view to building on previous successes and paving the way for future ambition to effectively tackle the global challenge of climate change. COP30 will take place in Belém, Brazil, from 10-21 November this year, with the themes include: reducing greenhouse gas emissions. adaptation to climate change. climate finance for developing countries. To ensure that fund can effectively respond to the needs of people and communities affected by climate change, all countries must work together. At the COP-29 conference, important discussions took placed on how to provide financial assistance through various innovative methods, including bonds and insurance. The G7 countries, known as the Global Shield, also discussed pre-planned insurance and other financial support for low-income countries affected by climate disasters such as floods, droughts, and hurricanes. Additionally, there have been suggestions in recent conferences to divert attention from the true 'loss and damage' fund to some grants. Most representatives from poorer countries have expressed a desire for grants, not loans or insurance, as these could further increase the debt burden on countries in South and Southeast Asia. Moreover, the pledges made by wealthy nations are not sufficient. Some countries alone require several trillion dollars in assistance to address the damage caused by climate change. Neither wealthy countries nor international financial management can adequately solve these challenges. Naturally, the affected countries are looking ahead to COP-30. They will seek resolutions on the unfinished issues from recent conferences and assurances for funding from developing countries, including those in South Asia. Experts Opinion Md. Shamsuddoha from Bangladesh's climate research organization (CPRD) states that Western countries now plan to profit from climate change. This development worker notes that they have significant surplus capital and are looking to invest in poorer nations under the guise of carbon trading. There is a growing suspicion that a form of carbon capitalism is beginning to take shape. Environmental activist Syeda Rizwana Hasan, who is currently serving as Environment, Forest and Climate Change Adviser to the interim government of Bangladesh, stated that it is not possible to wait until 2030 to take effective action against climate change. Advocating for justice for those affected by climate change, she emphasized that developed countries must urgently reduce emissions to meet the 1.5 degrees Celsius target and fulfill their commitments under the Paris Agreement. She also highlighted how Bangladesh, as a climate-vulnerable country, is confronting the realities of climate change every day, underscoring the need for coordinated global initiatives. Syeda Rizwana Hasan noted that in 2024, two devastating floods caused $1.7 billion in damages in Bangladesh, equivalent to 1.8 percent of the national budget. Over the past 18 months, Bangladesh has been affected by 15 climate-related natural disasters, displacing 1.2 million people. Despite contributing only 0.4 percent to global greenhouse gas emissions, the country suffers extreme losses. She further stated that Bangladesh has set a target to reduce emissions by 22 percent by 2030, which includes an unconditional reduction of 27 million tons and a conditional reduction of 61 million tons. Achieving these targets will require $45 billion in domestic funding and $135 billion in international assistance. Developed countries need to strengthen their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) based on climate justice, reduce reliance on market mechanisms, and uphold their commitments to high-quality climate financing."

"politics","https://www.risingbd.com/english/politics/news/111395","NY Times report on Bangladesh misleading, says CA press wing","01/04/2025","The New York Times article titled ""As Bangladesh Reinvents Itself, Islamist Hard-Liners See an Opening"" is a misleading one, said the Chief Adviser's Press Wing today (April 1). ""The New York Times article paints a troubling and one-sided view of Bangladesh, suggesting that the country is on the brink of being overtaken by religious extremism,"" the press wing said in a statement posted on its verified Facebook page - CA Press Wing Facts. This portrayal not only oversimplifies the political and social dynamics of the country but also risks unfairly smearing an entire nation of 180 million people, it mentioned. It is crucial to acknowledge the progress Bangladesh has made over the last year and the complexity of the situation, rather than relying on selective, incendiary examples that paint an inaccurate picture, according to the statement. Following is the detail of the statement: 1. Acknowledging Bangladesh's Progress and Challenges: While the article highlights certain incidents of religious tension and conservative movements, it overlooks the broader context of progress. Bangladesh has made substantial strides in improving the conditions for women, and the Interim Government has been particularly committed to their security and well-being. This is a government that has prioritised women's rights and security, a focus that stands in stark contrast to the bleak image painted in the article. One significant example is the ""Youth Festival 2025,"" where nearly 2.7 million girls from all corners of the country participated in 3,000 games and cultural activities. NativeClick Ads This widespread participation-across regions, marginalised communities, and even indigenous youth-underscores the thriving and dynamic engagement of women and girls in Bangladesh's social and cultural life. The fact that one soccer game faced opposition does not erase the success of the other 2,999 events, which were celebrated by countless participants and communities. To focus on a single interruption to one event misrepresents the vibrancy and determination of the country's youth, especially women. Another claim that Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus ""has not pushed back hard enough against extremist forces"" is not only false, but it also disregards his lifelong commitment to empowering women. As Chief Advisor Prof Yunus has been unwavering in his advocacy for women's rights. A father of two daughters, Yunus has built his entire career and the Grameen Bank around a deep belief in the power of women, which ultimately earned him the Nobel Prize. His dedication to advancing women's rights and protecting their freedoms is a cornerstone of his work and reputation. 2. Correcting Misconceptions About Religious Violence: In a country like Bangladesh, it is important to distinguish between political unrest and religious violence. Many of the clashes between different groups in the wake of Sheik Hasina's departure and since have been misrepresented as sectarian violence, when in reality, they were largely political in nature. Political factions often use religion to galvanise support, which complicates the issue and risks conflating political unrest with religious persecution. It is misleading to frame the entire situation as a sectarian conflict, as it ignores the true political and socio-economic factors at play. The Interim Government has made clear its commitment to protecting all minority communities, and its ongoing work with law enforcement and counterterrorism efforts underscores this commitment. Bangladesh's efforts to combat extremism through social reforms and collaboration with the international community should not be overshadowed by the spread of misinformation. 3. Bangladesh's Role on the Global Stage: Bangladesh is quietly transforming into one of Asia's economic powerhouses, with a growth trajectory that promises immense opportunities for global investors. Against all odds, Bangladesh's economy has stabilised, showing remarkable resilience. In the last seven months, exports have grown almost 12%. The banking sector has remained intact after the political upheaval, and the local currency exchange rate has held steady at around 123 BDT to the USD. Looking ahead, Bangladesh is projected to advance to become a middle income country by 2026, and potentially the world's 9th largest consumer market by 2030. Where is the recognition of the incredible work done by the 84-year-old Muhammad Yunus over the past eight months? He has been tirelessly crisscrossing the globe to secure a better future for Bangladesh. Just last week, during his visit to China, the Chinese government and businesses committed US$2.1 billion in loans, investments, and grants to Bangladesh. And next week, Dhaka will host the Investors Conference, bringing over 2,300 participants from 50 countries, including top officials from global companies like Meta, Uber, and Samsung. The world is increasingly recognising Bangladesh as a rising economic power. This is a story of hope, strength, and unprecedented opportunity-one that deserves to be told with the respect and attention it merits. 4. Avoiding Oversimplification and Smearing a Nation: The NY Times article provides a handful of incidents, such as the release of a man who hurled abuse at a woman, to paint a picture of a country spiraling into extremism. This approach is not only misleading but harmful. In a nation of 180 million people, it is unconscionable to define the entire country by a few isolated events. Bangladesh is a diverse and dynamic society with a rich history of resilience, culture, and progressive thought. Bangladesh is not alone in facing the challenge of religious extremism this is a global issue that many countries confront in different forms. However, Bangladesh has continuously worked to address these challenges through law enforcement, social reforms, and counterterrorism initiatives. The country's commitment to protecting its diverse population-whether Muslim, Hindu, Christian, or any other community-remains steadfast. While there will always be hardliners who spew hatred at rallies and on social media, it is our responsibility to deny them the oxygen their anger requires. Furthermore, the notion that the rise of extremism is an inevitable outcome of Bangladesh's political transition is far too deterministic. The country's democratic spirit and vibrant civil society are powerful forces that continue to hold back the full rise of extremist ideologies. While challenges remain, the long-term direction of Bangladesh will not be shaped solely by the actions of extremists. The people of Bangladesh, particularly its youth and women, are determined to continue the fight for a just, democratic, and inclusive society. Finally, Bangladesh's history of resilience, its commitment to democracy, and its focus on women's empowerment are all testaments to the fact that the country will continue to move forward, despite the challenges it faces. Rather than focusing on a few negative examples, we should recognise the broader picture of progress, resilience, and determination that defines Bangladesh today._BSS."

The Israeli military said the official - Hassan Bdeir - was a member of a Hezbollah unit and Iran’s Quds Force, and he had assisted the Palestinian group Hamas in planning a “significant and imminent terror attack against Israeli civilians”. The attacks on Beirut’s southern suburbs have resumed at a time of broader escalation in the region, with Israel having restarted Gaza strikes after a two-month truce and the United States hitting the Iran-aligned Houthis of Yemen in a bid to get them to stop attacking Red Sea shipping. Hezbollah lawmaker Ibrahim Moussawi said the Israeli attack amounted to “a major and severe aggression that has escalated the situation to an entirely different level”. Speaking in a televised statement after visiting the building that was struck, he called on the Lebanese state to “activate the highest level of diplomacy to find solutions”. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said the eliminated Hezbollah operative posed “a real and immediate threat”. “We expect Lebanon to take action to uproot terrorist organizations acting within its borders against Israel,” he said. Israel dealt severe blows to Hezbollah in the war, killing thousands of its fighters, destroying much of its arsenal and eliminating its top leadership, including Hassan Nasrallah. Hezbollah has denied any role in recent rocket attacks from Lebanon towards Israel, including one that prompted Israel to carry out an airstrike on the southern suburbs last Friday."

Besides, the experts said that an understanding must be reached with the US administration is needed as soon as possible to overcome this situation. At the same time, alternative markets for ready-made garments and other export products must be found. Experts and business leaders opined that Trump's tariffs will increase inflation in the United States, reducing the purchasing power of the country's citizens. This will reduce garment exports. It will take time to overcome this crisis by exporting ready-made garments to new markets, according to the experts. Economists in the country said that the United States has increased tariffs not only on Bangladeshi products but also on products from various countries around the world. There is a risk of inflation in the country due to the imposition of high tariffs. As inflation rises and consumer purchasing power declines, there is also a risk that the US economy will fall into a recession. As the United States is the top destination for ready-made garment exports, exports will decrease ultimately. It will have a negative impact on overall export earnings. However, if the government can reduce tariffs through negotiations with the US administration, the fear of a decline in export earnings would be fairly alleviated, experts opined. Former director of Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), Md. Mohiuddin Rubel said, “The United States has imposed or increased additional tariffs on products from around 60 countries. It will have an impact on those countries. The purchasing power of US citizens will decrease, inflation will increase, which will not be good for the country. Businessmen are worried about this.” If the Bangladesh government works on this, tariffs could be reduced, he added. NativeClick Ads BKMEA Executive President Fazlee Shamim Ehsan opined that tariff wars are not desirable in the modern world. These tariffs will not bring much success to the American economy. The profit margin on our exported products is very low. The United States thinks these products will be made in the USA. That is not possible. As these industries are labor-intensive based industries.” Initially we will face a storm for this tariff. Because buyers are always opportunists. Buyers will try to reduce the price of our products, he added. Zahid Hossain, former chief economist at the World Bank's Dhaka office, said there is no doubt that the new US tariff policy will have a negative impact on Bangladesh's exports.

The chief adviser made the remarks while speaking at the 6th Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) Summit in Bangkok, Thailand. Highlighting the aspects of the July uprising in Bangladesh, he said in 1971, hundreds of thousands of ordinary women and men, children and youth made supreme sacrifice in a nine-month long genocide, fighting against a brutal military. “Our people aspired for an inclusive, just and free society where every ordinary person could materialise his or her dreams. “Sadly, in the course of past fifteen years, our people, especially youth, progressively saw their spaces and rights curtailed. They witnessed deep erosion of almost every State institution and civic rights trampled,” Prof Yunus said. He said the common mass brought an end to the brutal authoritarian regime, at the expense of lives of close to 2,000 innocent people, mostly youth, including 118 children. “The people of Bangladesh witnessed a rebirth in her history,” he added.

We envision a region where all the countries and communities can engage based on equity, mutual respect, mutuality of interests and shared benefits,” he said. The chief adviser said BIMSTEC region hosts one-fifth of the global population while challenges abound, converting those challenges into opportunities holding considerable prospect for all. “Many label our demography as a ‘challenge’. Yet, there are enough instances to illustrate the untapped ‘promises’ of our population,” he said. In hosting the BIMSTEC Secretariat, he said, Bangladesh stands ready to unlock the vast potential of an organisation in a meaningful way. About the potential of BIMSTEC, Prof Yunus said energy security is fundamental to the sustainable development and economic resilience of the BIMSTEC region. “We must work together to harness our collective potential in renewable energy, cross-border electricity trade, and energy efficiency to ensure a secure and sustainable future for our people,” he said. Prof Yunus said he is confident that the BIMSTEC Agreement on Grid Interconnection signed in 2018 can act as a launching pad for cooperation in the field of energy. NativeClick Ads “As per our BIMSTEC commitment we are committed to enhancing connectivity, improving mutual trade and economic collaboration among all member countries,” he said. He also said promoting trade and investment, facilitating movements of people particularly of the young boys and girls within BIMSTEC is key to enhancing wellbeing of their people. “Currently, intra-regional trade stands at just 5.9%. As the lead country in Trade, Investment and Development Sector, Bangladesh would urge all to materialise implementation of the BIMSTEC Framework Agreement on FTA that we signed way back in 2004, that will ultimately contribute towards better connectivity,” he said. The BIMSTEC Master Plan on Transport Connectivity was adopted at the fifth BIMSTEC Summit, the chief adviser said, adding that its timely implementation is crucial for the countries. He said: “Some of the countries have accomplished much bilaterally. In order to reap the benefits of effective regional economic integration and development, the regional measures need to be materialised.” Bangladesh stands ready to extend all possible support for the implementation of the Master Plan, he added. Prof Yunus said the BIMSTEC Agreement on Maritime Transport Cooperation was signed yesterday, which will certainly contribute towards enhanced connectivity within BIMSTEC region particularly with the landlocked member states and seven sisters of India. Noting that the BIMSTEC has been in existence for 28 long years, he said to be candid, its impacts are not still felt across the member states and beyond. He said signing and ratification of the Charter and formulation of the relevant Rules of Procedure has accorded the BIMSTEC processes and institutions considerable strength. “Our civil society and private sector particularly stress BIMSTEC to take up tangible and result-oriented initiatives, and projects amongst our countries,” the chief adviser said. As Bangladesh assumes the BIMSTEC Chairmanship, he called upon all member states to extend their valued support in redeeming their collective commitments to revitalise the organisation. “We need a genuinely shared sense of mutual confidence and mutuality of interests, rising above our differences and divergences. Whatever we undertake or do collectively, we need to be driven by impact and results,” he said. The chief adviser stressed rediscovering the modalities and institutions of regional and sub-regional collaboration under the BIMSTEC. Addressing inequality of income and choices, balancing economy and ecology need to be overriding objectives in pursuing their sectoral cooperation, he said. “While each of our countries pursue our national interests, we also need to appreciate the same of ‘others’ in the table in shaping and moving our wider cooperative agenda,” Prof Yunus said. In a fast-moving world, comparing the developments of the past decade seems a bit distant past, he said, adding many of long-held norms, regulations are giving in. “I find institutions often struggling to meet people’s aspirations. In making our institutions fit-for-purpose, I have been advocating for an overhaul of the financial system as also launch innovative social businesses that would uphold dignity and ensure an individual’s security, not just augment wealth,” he said. Within and beyond the region, resources - capacities - solutions abound to address many of our endemic challenges, like climate change, the chief adviser said. “As much as we facilitate knowledge and technology amongst our seven countries, let us also open up to the world – the governments, the knowledge institutions, foundations, private sector – who would share our values and appreciate our needs,” he added.

The upper house passed the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024 early on Friday, a day after the lower house cleared it amid strong opposition criticism. Muslim leaders and opposition parties say the bill is ""unconstitutional"" and infringes on the rights of India's Muslim-minority community. But the government says the bill aims to make the management of waqf (Muslim properties) more transparent. The bill will now be sent to India's president for her assent before it becomes law. This approval is expected to come soon. Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the passing of the bill a ""watershed moment"". In a post on X, he said the waqf system [the system of governing waqf or Muslim properties] had been ""synonymous with a lack of transparency and accountability"" for decades. ""The legislation passed by parliament will boost transparency and also safeguard people's rights,"" he wrote. NativeClick Ads However, the opposition has been vociferous in their condemnation of the bill and allege that it is another ploy by the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to dilute the rights of minorities. Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge noted that while 288 members voted in favour of the bill in the lower house, a significant 232 opposed it. ""From this, we can guess that despite opposition from various parties, this bill was brought arbitrarily,"" he wrote on X. In Islamic tradition, a waqf is a charitable or religious donation made by Muslims for the benefit of the community. Such properties cannot be sold or used for any other purpose. They are important to India's 200 million Muslims as they are used for mosques, madrassas, graveyards and orphanages. The properties are governed by the Waqf Act, 1995, which mandated the formation of state-level boards to manage them. These boards include nominees from the state government, Muslim lawmakers, members of the state bar council, Islamic scholars and managers of waqf properties. Last August, the BJP government introduced a bill to amend the Waqf Act. The government said the changes proposed by the bill would modernise waqf administration and reduce legal loopholes. But Muslim leaders and opposition parties alleged that the amendments would give the government more control over these properties. The bill was sent to a panel for scrutiny. In February, the panel cleared the bill with some amendments._Agencies."

Nine of the dead were children, said President Volodymyr Zelensky, who grew up in Kryvyi Rih. Local officials said a ballistic missile had hit a residential area. Images showed at least one victim lying in a playground, while a video showed a large section of a 10-storey block of flats destroyed and victims lying on the road. Russia’s defence ministry later claimed a “high-precision missile strike” had targeted a meeting of “unit commanders and Western instructors” in a restaurant, and that up to 85 were killed. It provided no evidence. Ukraine’s military responded by saying that Russia was spreading false information to try to “cover up its cynical crime”. It said Moscow had fired an Iskander-M ballistic missile with a cluster warhead to maximise casualties. The attack, early on Friday evening, was among the deadliest on Kryvyi Rih since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, and comes as US President Donald Trump pushes for a ceasefire. Zelensky wrote on social media that at least five buildings had been damaged in Friday's strike: “There is only one reason why this continues: Russia doesn't want a ceasefire, and we see it.” The head of Kryvyi Rih’s defence, Oleksandr Vilkul, said a residential area was hit.

The “Hands Off” protest planners aimed to hold rallies in 1,200 locations, including in all 50 US states. Thousands of people turned out in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Washington DC, among other cities, on Saturday. Protesters cited grievances with Trump’s agenda ranging from social to economic issues. Coming days after Trump’s announcement that the US would impose import tariffs on most countries around the world, gatherings were also held outside the US, including in London, Paris and Berlin. In Boston, some protesters said they were motivated by immigration raids on US university students that have led to arrests and deportation proceedings. Law student Katie Smith said that she was motivated by Turkish international student Rumeysa Ozturk, whose arrest near Boston-area Tufts University by masked US agents was caught on camera last month. “You can stand up today or you can be taken later,” she said, adding: “I’m not usually a protest girlie.” In London, protesters held signs reading, “WTAF America?”, “Stop hurting people” and “He’s an idiot”. NativeClick Ads They chanted “hands off Canada”, “hands off Greenland” and “hands off Ukraine”, referencing Trump’s changes to US foreign policy. Trump has repeatedly expressed interest in annexing Canada and Greenland.

In Washington DC, thousands of protesters gathered to watch speeches by Democratic lawmakers. Many remarks focused on the role played in Trump’s administration by wealthy donors - most notably Elon Musk, who has served as an advisor to the president and spearheaded an effort to dramatically cut spending and the federal workforce. Florida Congressman Maxwell Frost denounced the “billionaire takeover of our government”. “When you steal from the people, expect the people to rise up. At the ballot box and in the streets,” he shouted. The protests come after a bruising week for the president and his allies. Republicans won a closely watched special Florida congressional election on Tuesday, but with slimmer margins than they had hoped. Wisconsin voters elected a Democratic judge to serve on the state supreme court, roundly rejecting a Musk-backed Republican candidate by almost 10 percentage points. In both states, Democrats sought to tap into voter anger towards the Trump administration’s policies and Elon Musk’s influence."

That exotic world is TOI-421 b, a boiling-hot ""sub-Neptune"" orbiting a star about 244 light-years from Earth whose atmosphere JWST recently probed in detail, reports space.com. ""One of the most exciting prospects in exoplanet science today is discovering the origin and makeup of sub-Neptunes, which are high-occurrence planets that have no solar system analog,"" the study team wrote in their paper, which was published Monday (May 5) in The Astronomical Journal Letters. Although JWST was specifically designed for this kind of investigation, the discovery is particularly exciting because little is known about this class of planets, which were first identified by NASA's pioneering Kepler space telescope. Before JWST, attempts to study the atmospheres of sub-Neptune planets using transmission spectra — the measurement of starlight filtered through a planet's atmosphere when it passes in front of its host star — often yielded flat or featureless spectra. So, rather than showing chemical fingerprints that could indicate the presence of atmospheric molecules like carbon dioxide, methane or water vapor, the spectra of sub-Neptunes have generally offered little useful information. Astronomers proposed that this lack of detail might be due to clouds or hazes, which could be obscuring the signals. But the study team thought that TOI-421 b might be different, and could therefore offer a unique opportunity. Previous observations with NASA's Hubble Space Telescope had shown that flat spectral features are common among sub-Neptunes with temperatures below about 1,070 degrees Fahrenheit (577 degrees Celsius). ""Sub-Neptunes hotter [than this threshold] are also expected to be haze free because methane, and thus the hydrocarbon precursors to haze formation, should be less abundant as carbon monoxide becomes the dominant carbon-bearing molecule,"" the team wrote in the new study. NativeClick Ads TOI-421 b, with an estimated atmospheric temperature of 1,340 degrees Fahrenheit (727 degrees C), falls into this potentially haze-free category — and, after observing two transits using JWST's Near Infrared Spectrograph and Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph instruments, the team was rewarded with a rich atmospheric profile. ""We saw spectral features that we attribute to various gases, and that allowed us to determine the composition of the atmosphere,"" Brian Davenport, a Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland who conducted the primary data analysis, said in the same statement. The team detected water vapor in TOI-421 b's atmosphere, along with possible signs of carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide. Notably, they did not find evidence of methane or carbon dioxide. The data also suggest that the atmosphere contains a significant amount of hydrogen. Some of these findings are surprising, challenging existing theories about the formation and evolution of sub-Neptune planets. ""We had recently wrapped our mind around the idea that those first few sub-Neptunes observed by Webb had heavy-molecule atmospheres, so that had become our expectation, and then we found the opposite,"" said Kempton. This means TOI-421 b may have formed and evolved differently than cooler sub-Neptunes, such as TOI-270 d, which was observed previously. The hydrogen-rich atmosphere is especially intriguing because it closely mirrors the composition of TOI-421 b's host star._Agencies."

The plan is under serious enough consideration that the US has discussed it with Libya’s leadership, the report said, while stressing a final agreement has yet to be reached. In exchange for resettling the Palestinians, the administration would release to Libya billions of dollars of funds the US froze more than a decade ago, NBC added. According to three of the sources quoted in the report, Israel has been kept in the loop about the administration’s talks on the matter. “These reports are untrue,” an administration spokesperson told NBC in response. “The situation on the ground is untenable for such a plan. Such a plan was not discussed and makes no sense.” There was no response from Israel or either of Libya’s two rival governments the report, which also said administration officials have discussed offering incentives such as free housing and possibly a financial stipend to encourage Palestinians to leave Gaza for the North African country. An official told the US network that it remains unclear where one million Palestinians from Gaza could be settled in the largely lawless Libya, which has been plunged into chaos and division since the 2011 civil war in which longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi was overthrown and killed. The NBC report also noted the logistical challenges involved in transporting one million people from Gaza to Libya, particularly with no airport in the Strip. NativeClick Ads US President Donald Trump triggered global perplexity in early February by suggesting the US “take over” Gaza and turn it into a “Middle East Riviera” while forcing its Palestinian inhabitants to relocate to Egypt, Jordan, or other countries. He has since said, however, that no Gazans would be expelled. Visiting the Middle East this week, Trump said he wanted the United States to “take” Gaza and turn it into a “freedom zone”: “I have concepts for Gaza that I think are very good. Make it a freedom zone. Let the United States get involved and make it just a freedom zone,” he said. “I’d be proud to have the United States have it, take it, make it a freedom zone.” While far-right ministers in Israel have urged using the ongoing war with Hamas as an opportunity to reestablish Israeli settlements in the Strip lauded the plan, the Palestinian Authority and Arab nations rejected it outright. Despite public opposition among the region’s leaders, the government has moved forward with plans to encourage Palestinians to relocate, though The Times of Israel found no meaningful change in Israel’s exit policy for Gaza residents in recent months."

The inhumane operation reportly happened on 08 May, the day Solicitor General assured the Supreme Court of India that any deportation would be carried out strictly in accordance with the procedure established by law. The United Nations has called for an investigation into “credible reports” that Indian authorities rounded up Rohingya refugees and expelled them, in some cases by putting them into the Andaman Sea off the shore of the same country they had escaped from, fearing persecution and death. “The idea that Rohingya refugees have been cast into the sea from naval vessels is nothing short of outrageous,” said Tom Andrews, the U.N. special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar. “I am seeking further information and testimony regarding these developments and implore the Indian government to provide a full accounting of what happened.” He urged the Indian government to refrain from “inhumane and life-threatening treatment of Rohingya refugees, including their repatriation into perilous conditions in Myanmar.” The Indian government did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Officials of right-wing governments across several Indian states rounded up thousands of Muslims, purportedly Rohingya or Bangladeshi people living illegally in India. Such labels, along with “Pakistani,” are often used to target Muslim migrants from other parts of India. The most sweeping actions were in Gujarat, in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s home state, and in Rajasthan. While a majority of those detained turned out to be Indian citizens and were later released, those who were identified as Rohingya and Bangladeshi have been deported in large numbers, including some with refugee documents that were supposed to give them protection. The People’s Union for Civil Liberties, an India-based human rights group, criticized the move. “At the very least, the Rohingyas are entitled to due process under existing law which requires that the detainee get notice, opportunity of hearing and representation,” the group said in a statement. NativeClick Ads Rohingya refugees in Delhi said Indian authorities had rounded up dozens of them last week. They were taken to a police station, and never returned. Sadeq Shalom, a Rohingya Christian refugee in New Delhi who works as an education consultant, said his older brother and several other family members were picked up and were part of a group of 40 people who were put into the sea. He said 15 of the 40 were Christians, and their pleas that they faced double persecution — as Rohingya from the state, and then as a Christian minority from the Muslim majority in their area — were in vain. Another refugee in New Delhi, David Nazir, said his elderly parents were picked up and were also among the 40 people put to sea. He learned what had happened to them only after Mr. Shalom got a call from his brother, who borrowed a fisherman’s phone upon reaching Myanmar’s shore. “He told me that the Indian authorities had forced them off a navy vessel in the Andaman Sea and made them swim into Myanmar territory with nothing but life jackets,” Mr. Shalom said in an interview. Their biggest fear, Mr. Nazir said, was that the Myanmar army, which they had fled, was waiting for them. But in his phone call, Mr. Shalom’s brother said that all 40 were safe with the National Unity Government of Myanmar, which began operating in resistance after the country’s 2021 military coup. Colin Gonsalves, a lawyer representing the Rohingya in India’s supreme court, said there are about 1,000 who have sought refuge in Delhi and about 20,000 all over India. On social media, the Indian government’s actions drew comparisons to how India’s own immigrants were recently deported from the United States by the Trump administration, sent home by plane in shackles — a move that spurred widespread outrage. Mr. Gonsalves said that his appeal at the country’s supreme court to put a pause on the deportations was rejected. “We expect a little more compassion,” Mr. Gonsalves said. “Throwing refugees into the sea and then they land up in a war zone is one of the most barbaric practices a nation can indulge in.” Source: Agencies"
